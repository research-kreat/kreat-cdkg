BACKGROUND OF THE NEW PLANT

The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar ofWeigela, grown as an ornamental plant for use in the garden and landscape. The new cultivar is known botanically asWeigela floridaand will be referred to hereinafter by the cultivar name ‘TMWG19-28’.

‘TMWG19-28’ originated from aWeigelabreeding program which the inventor carried out at the inventor's nursery in Ipswich, United Kingdom. The inventor had assembled a collection ofWeigelavarieties (both commercial varieties and inventor's proprietary selections). After hand pollination between many of the assembled plants, seeds were collected, sown, grown on and planted in the field for evaluation. The identities of the parents of ‘TMWG19-28’ are unknown.

The new cultivar ‘TMWG19-28’ was selected in the field in 2018 for its bright green foliage and low-growing plant habit, together with multicolored pink and white large inflorescences. ‘TMWG19-28’ is a colorful accent plant from spring through fall.

The inventor first asexually reproduced ‘TMWG19-28’ in 2018 in Ipswich, United Kingdom by the method of softwood cuttings. The inventor has determined that the unique characteristics of ‘TMWG19-28’ are stable and reproduce true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.

PP35568,"Latin name of the genus and species: The Latin name of the genus and species of the novel variety disclosed herein isCrassula ovata.

Variety denomination: The inventive variety ofCrassuladisclosed herein has been given the variety denomination ‘OVWOODS04’.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Parentage: ‘OVWOODS04’ originated as a naturally occurring, whole-plant mutation ofCrassula‘Crasmada’ (Community Plant Variety Rights grant number 43697), a variety developed and owned by the inventor. The inventor of ‘OVWOODS04’ is a commercial ornamental plant producer and regularly discovers mutations ofCrassulaat his greenhouse operation in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands. For said mutations which seem to exhibit commercial potential, cuttings are taken to produce trial plants which are subsequently grown for evaluation. The variety now called ‘OVWOODS04’ was initially discovered in March of 2018 as a whole-plant mutation of ‘Crasmada’ which exhibited a large size and dark green, glaucous foliage borne on long lateral branches. At the time of discovery, cuttings were taken and the resulting plants were evaluated at the inventor's greenhouse. After further evaluation it was determined that the candidate's foliage characteristics would prove favorable for commercial marketability. The new variety was given the breeder denomination ‘OVWOODS04’.

Asexual Reproduction: The variety now called ‘OVWOODS04’ was first asexually propagated by stem cuttings in March of 2018 at a greenhouse in Bleiswijk, The Netherlands and has since been vegetatively propagated through four additional generations. Through subsequent generations, the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The cultivar ‘OVWOODS04’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and the phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘OVWOODS04’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘OVWOODS04’ as a new and distinctCrassulacultivar:1.Crassula‘OVWOODS04’ exhibits a broad spreading to upright growth habit and an irregular broad obovate to globular profile; and2.Crassula‘OVWOODS04’ exhibits glossy succulent foliage; and3.Crassula‘OVWOODS04’ exhibits dark green foliage that is longitudinally blotched and marbled with a pale-yellow general coloration.

RE49771,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally relates to a bone plate which can be fixed to a bone by means of bone screws. More particularly, the present invention relates to a bone plate having a through hole with an internal thread to threadably receive a locking bone screw.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Bone plates with through holes comprising a cylindrical or conical interior thread to receive a locking head bone screw are commonly used in the field of osteosynthesis. Due to the threaded connection between the head of the bone screw and the through hole in the bone plate the bone screw is firmly anchored in the through hole in the bone plate. However, one problem that can arise is that if the bone screw is not exactly coaxially inserted with respect to the through hole axis the thread of the through hole can be damaged.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a bone plate being able to receive at least a central bone screw in such a way that the thread in the through hole in the bone plate is not damaged when a bone screw is inserted.

According to the present invention, described is a bone plate with a proximal surface, a bone-oriented distal surface and a through hole the wall of which has three or more straight or convex sections provided with projections such as thread or thread-like structures for receiving a screw head of a bone screw.

One of the advantages of the bone plate according to the present invention include a compact entry for setting at choice bone screws under a variable angle is provided in such a way that the thread in the through hole in the bone plate is not damaged when a bone screw is not coaxially inserted with respect to the longitudinal axis of the through hole. Furthermore, due to the configuration of a through hole with three or more straight or convex sections, a bone screw inserted through the through hole may be angled relative to a longitudinal axis of the through hole with a reduction of damage to the threads of the through hole.

In an exemplary embodiment of the bone plate, the through hole has a cross-sectional area orthogonal to the longitudinal axis with a center of the cross-sectional area being centered on the longitudinal axis and wherein each of the three or more straight or convex sections is limited by two radii intersecting each other in the center and enclosing an angle Ω which is smaller than or equal to 360°/n (where n is the number of straight or convex sections), as will be described in greater detail below.

In a further exemplary embodiment of the bone plate, the through hole has a cross-sectional area orthogonal to the longitudinal axis which is generally polygonal, preferably with rounded corners.

In a further embodiment of the bone plate, the through hole tapers in a direction towards a distal surface of the bone plate.

In again a further embodiment of the bone plate, the three or more straight or convex sections are radially symmetric.

In another embodiment of the bone plate, a thread or thread-like structure extends over the whole length of the three or more straight or convex sections.

In another embodiment of the bone plate, the thread or thread-like structure has a constant depth of thread within the straight or convex sections.

In yet another embodiment of the bone plate the depth of thread of the thread or thread-like structure decreases towards each end of each of the straight or convex sections.

In still another embodiment of the bone plate the depth of thread of the thread or thread-like structure decreases outside each end of each of the straight or convex sections.

In again another embodiment of the bone plate, the thread or thread-like structure extends over the whole periphery of the through hole.

In a further embodiment of the bone plate according to the present invention, the bone plate comprises two or more peripheral holes connected to and open to a through hole. The peripheral holes include a thread for receiving peripheral bone screws therein. The two or more peripheral holes are arranged peripherally around the through hole in such a way that they overlap with the through hole to form a composite hole structure able to receive two or more peripheral bone screws therein while a central bone screw is received in the through hole.

In a further embodiment of the bone plate each of the peripheral holes comprises a spherical recess penetrating partially into the bone plate from a proximal surface thereof. The advantage of this configuration is that a conventional cortex screw with an unthreaded spherical head may be introduced into such a peripheral hole at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis selected by the user.

In a further embodiment of the bone plate according to the invention, each of the peripheral holes and the through hole includes a thread for locking the screw received therein at a fixed angle.

In another embodiment of the bone plate, the peripheral holes include threading for receiving peripheral bone screws at user selected variable angles relative to the longitudinal axes of these peripheral holes while the through hole is configured to receive a central bone screw at a fixed angle.

In a further embodiment of the bone plate, the threads of the holes extend over at least half of a circumference of each of the holes.

In still a further embodiment of the bone plate, a number, N, of boles are arranged at the corners of a central through hole being generally polygonal with N corners. The polygon defined by the hole axes of the N holes, when viewed in a cross-section orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the through hole, can be a triangle, square, pentagon or hexagon.

In another embodiment of the bone plate the fixed angle of insertion of bone screws through the peripheral holes is in the range of ±0° to ±20°, preferably of ±8° to ±15° with respect to the longitudinal axis.

In yet another embodiment of the bone plate the pitch of the threads is in the range of 0.30 to 2.00 mm, preferably in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 mm.

In again another embodiment of the bone plate the threads are multiple threads. This allows the advantage that the pitch matches the bone thread pitch.

In still another embodiment of the bone plate the centers of two adjacent holes are at a distance of 4 to 15 mm from each other.

In a further embodiment of the bone plate the diameter of the holes is in the range of 3 to 10 mm.

In again a further embodiment of the bone plate, an inscribed circle to the wall of the central through hole has a diameter of 2 to 10 mm, preferably of 3 to 7 mm.

In another embodiment according to the present invention, the bone plate comprises at least one peripheral bone screw wherein the plate is made of stainless steel and the at last one peripheral bone screw is made of a CoCr alloy or vice versa. Thus, the advantage can be achieved that since the threads are less damaged by the plate according to the invention there is also less corrosion between plate and screws.

The present invention is directed to a system for the fixation of fractured or otherwise damaged bones via one or both of a variable angle insertion and a fixed angle insertion of a bone screw through a bone plate hole. Specifically, a bone plate according to the present invention is provided with a central through hole configured to receive a first bone screw therethrough at any user selected angle relative to a longitudinal axis of the through hole within a permitted range of angulation. A plurality of second bone screws may also be inserted through outlying portions of the bone plate hole, each defining a separate plate hole axis. The outlying portions of the bone plate hole are formed as substantially circular peripheral holes configured to overlap and be open to the through hole to form a composite hole having any of a plurality of shapes depending on the placement and number of the peripheral holes relative to the through hole, as will be discussed in greater detail with respect to particular embodiments. The peripheral holes may be configured with holes axes selected so that the second bone screws may only be inserted therethrough at predetermined angles relative to a surface of the bone plate. It is noted that although the peripheral holes and through holes are depicted with predetermined angles in the system of the present invention, these bone plate holes may extend through the bone plate at any angle without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention and may be selected to conform to the requirement of a particular procedure.

FIGS.1to8illustrate a first exemplary embodiment of the invention comprising a bone plate1including one through hole9and three partially cylindrical peripheral holes2arranged peripherally around the through hole9in such a way that they overlap with the through hole9and are open thereto, as will be described in greater detail below. It is noted that although the through hole9is depicted with a triangular cross-sectional shape, any other cross-sectional shape may be employed without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The bone plate1comprises a proximal surface7and a bone-oriented distal surface8. The through hole9has a longitudinal axis6connecting the proximal and distal surfaces7,8, the longitudinal axis6extending orthogonally to the proximal surface7. The through hole9is at least partially bordered by a wall10including three convex sections15provided with projections such as a thread5or thread-like structures for receiving a central bone screw30under a variable angle. As will be described in greater detail later, each of the three convex sections15ofFIG.1is curved with a predetermined radius of curvature. In an alternate embodiment (not shown), any number and combination of the convex sections15may be formed with a first radius of curvature while the remainder of the convex sections15may be formed with a second radius of curvature.

Each of the peripheral holes2each has a hole axis11extending between the proximal and distal surfaces7,8and are provided with a thread4for receiving peripheral bone screws20, as shown inFIGS.6-8. The peripheral holes2are arranged peripherally around the through hole9at equal angles relative to each other. In the embodiment shown where three peripheral holes2are employed, the axes11of the peripheral holes2, when viewed in a cross-section orthogonal to the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9, define an equilateral triangle. Furthermore, the three peripheral holes2overlap the through hole9in such a way that the peripheral holes2and through hole9form a composite hole structure suitable to receive 3 peripheral bone screws20, as shown inFIGS.5to8and/or one central bone screw30, as shown inFIGS.2to4. As shown inFIG.5, the peripheral holes2each also comprise a thread4, which, in one embodiment of the present invention, may be a multiple thread.

When viewed in a cross-section orthogonal to the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9, each of the convex sections15is centrally positioned along a respective corner of an equilateral triangle. Each convex section15is convexly curved in a direction from the proximal surface7to the distal surface9so that an apex of each of the convex sections15is located radially outside the through hole9. A bone screw30can be inserted into the through hole9under a surgeon selected angle so that a screw axis33of the bone screw30is offset by an angle α relative to the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9. The through hole9of the present invention may be configured so that the bone screw30insertable therethrough is smaller, larger or the same size as the bone screws20insertable through the peripheral holes2.

The composite hole structure therefore includes three radially symmetrically arranged convex sections15centrally located on the sides of an equilateral triangle and three peripheral holes2in the corners of the equilateral triangle. The axes11of the peripheral holes2are arranged at a distance from the longitudinal axis6which is dimensioned in such a way that the peripheral holes2overlap the through hole9and extend over an angle of more than 180° between their transitions to the through hole9. The wall10of the through hole9comprises n=3 wall portions with each wall portion being limited by a transition to the periphery of a first peripheral hole2at one of its ends and by a transition to the periphery of a second peripheral hole2at its other end. In the present embodiment each convex section15does not extend over the whole length of the wall portion limited by the transitions. The thread5or thread-like structure extends over the whole length of the three convex sections15with a constant depth of thread. The depth of thread of the thread5or thread-like structure decreases between each end of the convex section15and each of the two transitions to one of the peripheral holes2.

As illustrated inFIGS.2to4the through hole9tapers radially inward toward the distal surface8of the bone plate1. A central bone screw30with a screw axis33and a screw head31is inserted in the through hole9. The screw head31is spherically shaped and comprises an external thread32so that the central bone screw30can he inserted into the through hole at a user-selected angle α between the screw axis33and the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9.

Instead of a central bone screw30comprising a spherically shaped screw head31with an external thread32a central bone screw comprising a conically shaped screw head with an external thread could be inserted into the through hole9. In the latter case the central bone screw would be inserted into the through hole9at a fixed angle (e.g., with the screw axis and the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9coinciding).

As shown inFIGS.7and8, the peripheral holes2are configured so that each of the hole axes11is angled at approximately 20° relative to the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9. In another embodiment of the present invention, the peripheral holes2may be angled at any other angle relative to the longitudinal axis6and may optionally also each extend along different angles, as those skilled in the art will understand.

As illustrated inFIG.7each of the peripheral holes2tapers radially inward towards the distal surface8of the bone plate1. A peripheral bone screw20with a screw axis23and a screw head21is inserted into each of the peripheral holes2. The screw head21is conically shaped and comprises an external thread22so each peripheral bone screw20can be inserted into one of the peripheral holes2at a fixed angle with the screw axis23and the hole axis11of the peripheral hole2coinciding.

Instead of peripheral bone screws20comprising conically shaped screw heads21with an external thread22, peripheral bone screws comprising spherically shaped screw heads with an external thread may be inserted into the peripheral holes2. In the latter case the peripheral bone screws may be inserted at a user selected variable angle between the screw axis23and the hole axis11of the peripheral hole2.

InFIGS.9to11another embodiment is illustrated which differs from the embodiment ofFIGS.1to8only in that the generally polygonal through hole9comprises rounded corners instead of the N=3 peripheral holes2arranged in the corners. Similarly to the embodiment ofFIGS.1to8, the wall10of the through hole9comprises n=3 convex sections15which in a cross-section orthogonal to the longitudinal axis6are centrally located on the sides of an equilateral triangle. Each of the convex sections15is convexly curved in a cross-section orthogonal to the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9with the apex of each convex section15located on a middle line orthogonal to one side of the equilateral triangle. Due to the convex sections15, a bone screw30may be inserted into the through hole9under a surgeon selected angle relative to the axis6.

The through hole9includes three radially symmetrically arranged convex sections15centrally located on the sides of an equilateral triangle and three concavely rounded sections in the corners of the equilateral triangle. The wall10of the through hole9therefore comprises n=3 wall portions whereof each wall portion extends along one side of an equilateral triangle and is limited by a transition to a first concavely rounded section at one of its ends and by a transition to a second concavely rounded section at its other end. In the present embodiment each convex section15extends over the whole length of the wall portion limited by the transitions. The thread5or thread-like structure extends over the whole periphery of the through hole9. The depth of thread of the thread5or thread-like structure can decrease in the concavely rounded sections.

As illustrated inFIG.10the through hole9tapers towards the distal surface8of the bone plate1. A central bone screw30with a screw axis33and a screw head31is inserted in the through hole9. The screw head31is spherically shaped and comprises an external thread32so that the central bone screw30can be inserted into the through hole at a user-selected variable angle α between the screw axis33and the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9.

InFIGS.12to14another embodiment of the bone plate1is illustrated which comprises two through holes9. Similarly to the embodiment ofFIGS.9to11, the through hole9has cross-sectional area orthogonal to the longitudinal axis6with a center14located on the longitudinal axis6with each of the n=3 convex sections15being limited by two radii intersecting each other in the center14and enclosing an angle Ω which is smaller than 120°. The wall10of each of the two through holes9comprises n=3 wall portions with each wall portion extending along one side of an equilateral triangle and limited by a transition to a first concavely rounded section at one of its ends and by a transition to a second concavely rounded section at its other end. Similarly to the embodiment ofFIGS.9to11, each convex section15extends over the whole length of the wall portion limited by the transitions. The through holes9differ from the through hole9of the embodiment ofFIGS.9to11only in that the thread5or thread-like structure does not extend over the whole periphery of the through hole9. The depth of thread of the thread5or thread-like structure decreases on each end of the convex section15at the transition between the convex section15and the concavely rounded section in such a way that a portion of the concavely rounded sections is unthreaded.

As illustrated inFIG.13the through hole9tapers radially inward toward the distal surface8of the bone plate1. Similarly to the embodiment ofFIGS.9to11, a central bone screw30with a screw axis33and a screw head31can be inserted in the through hole9. By using a central bone screw30the screw head31of which is spherically shaped with an external thread32, the central bone screw30may be inserted into the through hole9at a user-selected, variable angle α of the screw axis33to the longitudinal axis6of the through hole9.

FIG.15illustrates a further embodiment of the through hole9which differs from the embodiment ofFIGS.12to14only in that it comprises n=4 convex sections15. Each of the n=4 convex sections15is limited by two radii intersecting each other in the center14and enclosing an angle Ω which smaller than 90°. The wall10of each of the two through holes9comprises n=4 wall portions with each wall portion extending along one side of a square and limited by a transition to a first concavely rounded section at one of its ends and by a transition to a second concavely rounded section at its other end. Similarly to the embodiment ofFIGS.9to11, each convex section15extends over the whole length of the wall portion limited by the transitions. The thread5or thread-like structure does not extend over the whole periphery of the through hole9. The depth of thread of the thread5or thread-like structure decreases on each end of the convex section15at the transition between the convex section15and the concavely rounded section in such a way that a portion of the concavely rounded sections is unthreaded.

FIG.16illustrates again a further embodiment of the through hole9which differs from the embodiment ofFIG.15only in that the wall10of the through hole9comprises n=4 straight sections15and that the depth of thread of the thread5or thread-like structure decreases from a middle line orthogonal to one side of the square towards the transition between the straight section15and each of the concavely rounded sections in such a way that the concavely rounded sections are unthreaded.

FIGS.17and18illustrate again a further embodiment of the through hole9which differs from the embodiment ofFIG.14only in that the N=3 peripheral holes2are configured to receive conventional cortex screws. Each peripheral hole2comprises a spherical recess25penetrating partially into the bone plate1from the proximal surface7and axially adjacent to a conically enlarging lower section26extending between the spherical recess25and the distal surface8of the bone plate1. Due to the spherical recess25, a conventional cortex screw with a spherical head may be inserted into each of the peripheral holes2at a user-selected angle with respect to the axis11of the peripheral hole2. The n=3 straight or convex sections15of the wall10of the through hole9are configured similarly to the embodiment ofFIG.14.

RE49772,"FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY

The present disclosure relates generally to an omnidirectional locomotion system and apparatus that can be used in conjunction with virtual reality systems, and more specifically to a hardware layout and software methods of a omnidirectional locomotion system and related components.

BACKGROUND

The present disclosure generally relates to locomotion devices that can be used in conjunction with virtual reality systems.

Within a virtual reality environment, users typically desire the ability to walk freely. In particular, the ability to physically walk or run in the real environment and have that motion translated to the virtual environment significantly increases the level of immersion of the user in the virtual environment. However, movement in the real world is often limited by physical space boundaries (e.g., the size of the room within which the user is located). Accordingly, locomotion devices are designed to provide the user the sensation of walking freely, while confining the user to a specific location. For example, many locomotion devices allow a user to walk freely, in 360 degrees, on a platform having a finite size without ever leaving the platform.

Conventional locomotion devices include motorized and non-motorized designs, which may be used in conjunction with virtual reality environments in a multitude of applications including, but not limited, to gaming. Examples of applications beyond gaming include employee training; combat training; physical therapy; exercise; virtual work environments; virtual meeting rooms (for both professional and personal purposes); sports simulation and training; and virtual tourism, concerts, and events.

Motorized locomotion devices typically use sensors to detect the movement of the user and send feedback to motors driving belts or rollers on which the user moves. The belts or rollers are operated to counter the user's movements and bring the user back to a central portion of the platform after each step. There are many drawbacks to motorized locomotion devices. For example, the motorized locomotion devices are usually complex and expensive because of the rolling and motorized components, sensors, processing units, and feedback loops. In addition, complex algorithms are required for the rolling and motorized components to properly counter the movements of the user. Inaccurate feedback to the motor can result in erroneous movement of the belts or rollers that may cause the user to lose balance or drift away from the center of the platform. There may also be issues with latency of feedback and response when the user accelerates, causing incorrect movements or responses that are too slow, potentially allowing the user walk off the platform. Further, because the response movements of the belts or rollers counteract the user's movements, the user may be prone to lose balance and trip.

In addition to issues with the operation of motorized locomotion devices, such devices are usually large and bulky, and thus, do not fit in the average-sized residential room (e.g., a game room, living room, or bedroom) and can be difficult to break up into modular pieces for shipping and storage. The devices are necessarily large, to prevent the user from walking off the platform before the correct system response has been processed; thus, rendering the devices unsuitable for in-home consumer usage.

Non-motorized locomotion devices lack motorized components and, thus, rely on the user's movement and/or gravity to bring the user back to the center of the platform after each step. Omnidirectional ball bearing platforms, for example, have hundreds of ball bearings that allow the user to walk in place while a restraint around the user's waist keeps the user in place. A major issue with omnidirectional ball bearing platforms is that the user does not experience a natural gait with a heel-toe strike movement, but rather instability similar to that of walking on ice. The instability results in the shuffling of feet where neither heel nor toe lift off the device, resulting in an unnatural walking gait that reduces the immersion of the user in the virtual environment. Moreover, these devices are typically heavy and expensive due to the plurality of rolling components.

Accordingly, there remains a need for locomotion devices that allow users to safely access virtual environments while providing the sensation of a more natural walking gait.

SUMMARY

The embodiments described herein are generally directed to a locomotion system for use with a virtual environment technology comprising a platform configured to support a user, a lower platform configured to support the platform and the user while entering the platform, an adjustable struts coupled to the platform and extending upwardly, at variable heights, from the platform, wherein the harness support assembly includes a support halo positioned above the platform and extending about a vertical central axis, and a harness configured to be worn by the user. The harness includes one or more sleds moveably coupled to the support halo.

In an embodiment, a locomotion system for use with a virtual environment technology comprises a platform configured to support a user, struts coupled to the platform and extending upwardly from the platform, wherein the struts includes a support halo positioned above the platform and extending about a vertical central axis, and a harness including a belt configured to be worn by the user, one or more sleds coupled to the belt, and a vertical member coupled to the belt. The sleds slidingly engages an upper and lower surface of the support halo, and the vertical member is disposed within the support halo and is configured to limit the radial movement of the interface structure relative to the support halo.

In an embodiment, a harness for use in an omnidirectional locomotion system comprising a sit harness coupled to a support frame, two upper sleds removably coupled to the support frame by a connection rod, wherein the upper sled is located above a halo, two lower sleds removably coupled to the support frame by a vertical member, wherein the lower sled is located below the halo.

In an embodiment, a virtual reality system comprises a locomotion system including a platform configured to support a user, struts coupled to the platform, and a harness configured to be worn by the user. The struts include a support halo positioned above the platform and extending about a vertical central axis, and wherein the harness is configured to move relative to the support halo. The virtual reality system can further comprise one or more sensors, for example, inertial measurement unit (IMU) configured to detect, track, and transmit the motion of the user to a print circuit board, light emitting diodes (LED) configured to display status information to the user, a cabling system and panel configured to prevent accidental removal, and a visual display in communication with the processing unit, and one or more accessories configured to be handled or used by the user.

The movement of a user in the omnidirectional locomotion system can be determined by data collected from the one or more sensors, for example IMUs. One or more sensors can be removably attached to the user's footwear, harness, accessory, head, arms, or any other location on the user or user accessory. When the user begins movement in any direction the sensors can stream raw gyro data to an aggregator board, for example at 100 Hz. The aggregator board can collect and analyze the data to determine the angular velocity (rate of rotation per second) coming from the gyro that is perpendicular to the direction of the motion. In other embodiments, the sensors can include, but are not limited to capacitance sensors, inertial sensors (IMU), ambient light sensors, magnetic tracking sensors, acoustic sensors, pressure sensors, optical tracking sensors, hall effect sensor, and infrared sensors.

The term “coupled” refers to limitation of movement in the virtual environment with reference to the direction in which the user is looking or where the camera is pointed within the virtual environment.

The term “decoupled” refers to the ability to move in the virtual environment independent of the direction in which the user is looking or the camera is pointed within the virtual environment. In an embodiment, it refers to the ability of the user to walk in any direction on the virtual reality platform (walk movements translated into gamepad input for a computer application that accepts gamepad input) independent of a direction in which the user is looking in the virtual environment. Movements when decoupled are therefore not bound by the direction of the camera or display, when the user is moving, thus enabling a user to look or have a display positioned in any angle, irrespective of the users intended feet and body movement, motion, or direction.

The term “POD” refers generally to a specific type of sensor system, namely a sensor coupled with a multi-controller unit with short-range wireless capabilities. In the present disclosure, the term POD can be interchangeably with the term sensor. The present disclosure in general describes a POD, however, other sensors can be implemented as well, for example, capacitance sensors, inertial sensors (IMU), ambient light sensors, magnetic tracking sensors, acoustic sensors, pressure sensors, optical tracking sensors, hall effect sensor, and infrared sensors.

Current video games use a relative orientation framework. Pushing a joystick to the right or pressing “D” on a keyboard can move a user's avatar 90 degrees to the right from a current viewpoint or camera position. The current camera position can be obtained by measuring a direction of a head mounted display, for example, a virtual reality headset. Thus in the relative orientation framework, movement can be relative to the current camera position. To further illustrate, pushing the joystick up or “W” on the keyboard can move the user's avatar in the forward in the current camera position.

In an embodiment, a game can use an absolute orientation framework (decoupled framework). When a game is played using an omnidirectional locomotion platform a user's avatar can move independently from the current viewpoint or camera position. The user's avatar can move in an absolute manner relative to an in-game map. For example, if the user walks the direction north on omnidirectional locomotion platform, the user's avatar can move north on the in-game map, regardless of the current camera position. In an embodiment, the head mounted display can include a sensor, for example, a magnetometer. The sensor can use an absolute orientation framework similar to omnidirectional locomotion platform, wherein the current in-game camera position can be the direction the user is physically looking outside the game.

In an embodiment, the direction “north” can be magnetic north or polar north. In another embodiment, the direction “north” can be a designated direction set or calibrated at a start of a game. For example, a user wearing a head mounted display (virtual reality headset), can look forward relative to the user's body during calibration, which can calibrate the current forward looking direction with a forward walking orientation prior to decoupling the current camera position and the user's body position. In another embodiment, the halo or harness of an omnidirectional locomotion system, can include sensors to calibrate the forward position of a user with the forward orientation in-game prior to decoupling the current camera position and the user's body position. In another embodiment, upon initiation of a game the current position of the user outside of the game, determined by the sensors in omnidirectional locomotion platform, the harness, or the headset can be calibrated to the starting position of the game. For example, if an in-game user is initiated facing east, then the direction the outside user is facing when the game is initiated can be calibrated east.

In an embodiment, decoupling can be implemented in existing games. Existing games are not configured for decoupling, however the decoupling effect can still be achieved by generating one or more keystrokes based on the user's current camera position. For example, if the user walks forward on the omnidirectional locomotion platform while looking 90 degrees to the left, decoupling can be accomplished by generating the “D” key or left movement key. The absolute orientation framework can be converted to the relative orientation framework by taking into account the current camera direction.

FIG.33is a flow chart of an example method of a fully decoupled velocity and heading. Method510illustrated inFIG.33is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the method. Additionally, while the example method is illustrated with a particular order of steps, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate thatFIG.33and the steps illustrated therein can be executed in any order that accomplishes the technical advantages of the present disclosure and can include fewer or more steps than illustrated.

Each block shown inFIG.33represents one or more processes, methods, or subroutines, carried out in example method. The steps illustrated inFIG.33can at least be implemented in a system including an omnidirectional locomotion system130, POD system400, and/or POD communication system490. Additional steps or fewer steps are possible to complete the example method. Each block shown inFIG.33can be carried out by at least a system including an omnidirectional locomotion system130, POD system400, and/or POD communication system490. Alternatively, in another embodiment, each block shown inFIG.33can be carried out without the use of an omnidirectional locomotion system130.

Method510can begin at block511. At block511, a pedometry rate of a user is determined by acceleration data received at an aggregator board from one or more PODs. In another embodiment, gyro data is received at an aggregator board. The pedometry rate can be the frequency of user steps during a predefined interval. In an embodiment, the pedometry rate can be determined by monitoring an acceleration of a user's feet during a predefined interval. In another embodiment acceleration data is received at a PCB that is separate from an aggregator. In another embodiment, accelerated data is received at a computing device bypassing an aggregator or PCB to determine a pedometry rate. In another embodiment, a change in rotation can be determined in place of a pedometry rate. When a pedometry rate is determined at block511, the method can move to block512.

At block512, the determined pedometry rate of a user is used to calculate a velocity. A velocity is calculated by looking for peaks in acceleration followed by high frequency noise to indicate foot impact. Rate and magnitude of the relative energy in each foot step, as measured by the duration and peak of the acceleration, is used to calculate the rate of steps. In an embodiment, the velocity can be an average velocity. In another embodiment, the velocity can be a median velocity. In another embodiment, the velocity can be an angular velocity. When a velocity is calculated at block512, the method can move to block513.

At block513, a heading is calculated for the one or more IMU. A corrected orientation is translated into real physical world axes to provide a heading of one or more PODs. In one embodiment, the one or more POD orientations can be averaged to provide an aggregate combined heading. In an embodiment, one or more PODs can be located on user's head, torso, feet, legs, arms, an accessory, halo, or harness. When a heading is determined at block513, a method can move to block514.

At block514, the heading and velocity can be translated into 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (X, Y). The translated coordinates can represent gamepad and/or joystick values. For example, the velocity can be a magnitude or amplitude of the X and Y values and the heading can be translated into degree angles from relative magnetic North of the Earth. When the heading and velocity are translated into coordinates at block514, the method can move to block515.

At block515, the coordinates are normalized into a minimum to maximum scale range, as defined by USB HID joystick/game pad descriptors. By virtue of control decoupled from camera view, additional movements such as walking backward, left and right strafing can be enabled. When the coordinates are normalized method510can end.

Method510can be used for a decoupled forward movement. A forward movement can be a relative movement in the Y direction relative to the center of one or more PODs, and generates a movement in the Y gamepad/joystick direction. An acceleration when a user foot is in the air can be measured in the direction of the heading of the foot. A forward velocity measurement can be then translated into “real world” coordinates relative to magnetic North of the Earth. All other motions not in the forward Y-axis of a POD, relative to the POD body, can be ignored to disallow spurious or false movements in alternate directions confining the motion identification process to forward motions.

Method510can be used for a decoupled backwards movement. A backwards movement can be a relative movement in the Y direction relative to the center of one or more PODs, and generates a movement in the Y gamepad/joystick direction. An acceleration when a user foot is in the air can be measured in the opposite direction of the heading of the foot. A backwards velocity measurement can be then translated into “real world” coordinates relative to magnetic North of the Earth. All other motions not in the backwards Y-axis of an POD, relative to the POD body, are ignored to disallow spurious or false movements in alternate directions confining the motion identification process to forward motions.

Method510can be used for a decoupled side movement or strafe movement. A side movement can be a relative movement in the X direction relative to the center of one or more POD, and generates a movement in the X gamepad/joystick direction. An acceleration when a user's foot is in the air can be measured in the perpendicular direction of the heading of the foot. A side velocity measurement can be then translated into “real world” coordinates relative to magnetic North of the Earth. All other motions not in the X-axis of a POD, relative to the POD body, are ignored to disallow spurious or false movements in alternate directions confining the motion identification process to forward motions.

FIG.34is a flow chart of an example method of a coupled forward, backward, and side-to-side movements. Method520illustrated inFIG.34is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the method. Additionally, while the example method is illustrated with a particular order of steps, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate thatFIG.34and the steps illustrated therein can be executed in any order that accomplishes the technical advantages of the present disclosure and can include fewer or more steps than illustrated.

Each block shown inFIG.34represents one or more processes, methods, or subroutines, carried out in example method. The steps illustrated inFIG.34can at least be implemented in a system including an omnidirectional locomotion system130, POD system400, and/or a POD communication system490. Additional steps or fewer steps are possible to complete the example method. Each block shown inFIG.34can be carried out by at least a system including an omnidirectional locomotion system130, POD system400, and/or POD communication system490. Alternatively, in another embodiment, each block shown inFIG.34can be carried out without the use of an omnidirectional locomotion system130.

Method520can begin at block521. At block521, acceleration data is received at an aggregator from one or more PODs is used to determine a pedometry rate of a user. In another embodiment acceleration data is received at a PCB that is separate from an aggregator. In another embodiment, accelerated data is received at a computing device bypassing an aggregator or PCB to determine a pedometry rate. When a pedometry rate is determined at block521, the method can move to block522.

At block522, the determined pedometry rate of a user is used to calculate a velocity. A velocity is calculated by looking for peaks in acceleration followed by high frequency noise to indicate foot impact. Rate and magnitude of the relative energy in each foot step, as measured by the duration and peak of the acceleration, is used to calculate the rate of steps. When a velocity is calculated at block522, the method can move to block523.

At block523, a heading is calculated for the one or more PODs. An orientation of the one or more PODs is translated into relative body axes of the one or more PODs to determined an intended direction of motion. In one embodiment, the one or more PODs orientations can be averaged to provide an aggregate combined heading. In an embodiment, one or more PODs can be located on user's head, torso, feet, legs, arms, an accessory, halo, or harness. In this embodiment, real world coordinates are not calculated and are not used to provide heading. The one or more PODs relative self-orientations are then averaged to provide a heading. When a heading is calculated at block523, a method can move to block524.

At block524the aggregated combined heading and velocity can be translated into 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (X-axis and Y-axis). The translated coordinates can represent gamepad and joystick values. For example, the velocity can be a magnitude of the X and Y values and heading (orientation) is translated into degrees 90 degree angle increments from the forward (relative to Y-axis of the PODS). When the heading and velocity are translated into coordinates at block524, the method can move to block525.

At block525the coordinates are normalized into a minimum to maximum scale range, as defined by USB HID joystick/game pad descriptors. When the coordinates are normalized method520can end.

Method520can be used for forward and backwards coupled movements. Forward and backwards can be relative movement in the Y direction relative to the center of the PODs, and generates a movement in the Y gamepad/joystick direction. An acceleration when a user's foot is in the air can be measured in the direction of the camera position for forward movement and in the opposite direction of the camera position for backwards movement. All other axes, relative to the PODs, can be ignored to disallow spurious or false movements in alternate directions, therefore confining the motion identification process to forward and backwards motions.

Method520can be used for side coupled movement or strafing coupled movements. Side movements can be relative movement in the X direction relative to the center of the PODs, and generates a movement in the X gamepad/joystick direction. An acceleration when a user foot is in the air can be measured in the perpendicular direction of the camera position. All other axes, relative to the PODs, can be ignored to disallow spurious or false movements in alternate directions, therefore confining the motion identification process to side motions.

In determining movement of a user of an omnidirectional locomotion system, it is desirable to decrease the time for detecting walking has begun on the omnidirectional locomotion platform. A delay in detection can be perceived as lag between a user's movement on the platform and a user's avatar in a virtual environment. An additional layer for improved step detection performance for the initial step is specified in an embodiment where triggering off an acceleration above a minimum level (threshold) in the forward Y-direction (relative to the POD coordinates) generates a user movement in gamepad/joystick coordinates (relative to real world North of the Earth). This trigger can be armed during times when a motion library has not completed calculating acceleration and velocity intensities. Relative strength of the acceleration energy can be used to ease a transition from a “first step” trigger motion into a full motion library, for example, forwards walking, backwards walking, running, crouching, strafe, creep, jumping or any additional motion gestures detectable on the omnidirectional locomotion system. The trigger has a rate independent hysteresis to alleviate an appearance of jitteriness in user motions caused by noise in measured accelerometer data.

Decreasing a lag between the cessation of movement and its detection is specified in an embodiment which triggering off an acceleration below a maximum level in all relative directions (relative to the POD coordinates) forces user movement to stop. This trigger is armed during times when the motion library has identified intended user motions. The trigger has a rate independent hysteresis as to alleviate the appearance of jitteriness in user motions caused by noise in the measured accelerometer data.

FIG.35is a flow chart of an example method of detecting a quick stop of a user movement. Method530illustrated inFIG.35is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the method. Additionally, while the example method is illustrated with a particular order of steps, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate thatFIG.35and the steps illustrated therein can be executed in any order that accomplishes the technical advantages of the present disclosure and can include fewer or more steps than illustrated.

Each block shown inFIG.35represents one or more processes, methods, or subroutines, carried out in example method. The steps illustrated inFIG.35can at least be implemented in a system including an omnidirectional locomotion system130, a POD system400, and a POD communication system490. Additional steps or fewer steps are possible to complete the example method. Each block shown inFIG.35can be carried out by at least a system including an omnidirectional locomotion system130, a POD system400, and a POD communication system490. Alternatively, in another embodiment, each block shown inFIG.35can be carried out without the use of an omnidirectional locomotion system130.

Method530can begin at block531. At block531, the method can receive, from one or more PODs, raw gyro data. In an embodiment the raw gyro data can be an angular velocity. The angular velocity can be used to determine if a user is moving forward or backwards, for example walking forwards/backwards or running forwards/backward by the change in rotation of a user's feet. In an embodiment if the angular velocity is non-zero the user can be moving. In another embodiment, the angular velocity can be determined by receiving the one or more POD data over a predefined interval. In another embodiment, the received data can be acceleration data for calculating a velocity. If at block531it is determined that the user is moving, the method can move to block532.

At block532, the method can normalize or smooth the raw data by applying a filter. In an embodiment, the raw gyro data can be run through a fast stopping filter. In regard to the fast stopping filter, the received raw gyro data can be run through an exponential moving average (EMA) filter, then the smoothed (filtered) values can be compared to previous smoothed values, to determine a smooth delta resulting in a smoothed gyro data graph. In another embodiment, the raw gyro data can be run through an analog speed filter. In regard to the angle speed filter the raw gyro x-axis values for both feet PODs can be run through an EMA filter to calculate the absolute value of each gyro. The filtered values can be added together, scaled, and then an offset is added. In an embodiment the offset can be a scale offset, i.e., so the value falls within a valid joystick output value. The offset value can then run through an EMA filter. The EMA filter can be a new EMA filter or the previously mentioned EMA filter. The result is a smooth output that is approximately equivalent to a velocity, for example a walking velocity. An example smoothed gyro data graph can be seen inFIG.36. When a filter has been applied the method can move to block533.

At block533, the method can determine if the smoothed gyro data at block532drops within a predefined threshold. In an embodiment the smoothed gyro data can be an angular velocity (rate of rotation per second) in the direction of motion. For example, the angular velocity can be determined from the gyro axis perpendicular to the direction of the motion. The predefined threshold can be used to determine when the user is slowing down. In an embodiment, predefined threshold can be 0.33 degrees per second. The angular velocity can be monitored at a predetermined interval, for example 1 ms, 5 ms, 10 ms, 15 ms, and 20 ms. As shown inFIG.36, when the angular velocity of POD501and POD502drops within a predefined threshold503the movement of the user can be slowing down. In an embodiment, to prevent a false stop detection, the predefined threshold can be determined dynamically based on the velocity of the user movement. For example, when the velocity is calculated at a slow speed (walking or creeping) the predefined threshold can be a tighter window making the trigger points smaller. When the forward velocity is calculated at a high speed (running) the predefined threshold can be a larger window making the trigger points larger. In another embodiment to prevent a false stop a decay can be added when the angular velocity drops to the predefined threshold. The added decay can alleviate any stuttering effect. The decay is an exponential decay calculated mathematically, to have a gradual transition towards zero. When the smoothed gyro data has dropped below the predefined threshold, the method can move to block534.

At block534, the method can determine when the slope of the smoothed gyro data has approached zero for a predefined interval. For example, during a predefined interval of 1 ms, 5 ms, 10 ms, 15 ms, or 20 ms. When the slope of the angular velocity continues to approach zero, a stop can be detected. In an embodiment, a stop can be detected when the slope is less than 0.01 degrees per second squared. Alternatively, if during this same interval the slope does not continue to approach zero, a stop cannot be detected. In an embodiment, the slope deltas (during the predefined interval) can be analyzed to locate a peak. The velocity can be set to the maximum of each peak until the next peak is located, which then can be set to the velocity. In another embodiment, when the angular velocity slope is within a minimum predefined window, a counter is incremented. If the counter reaches seven, the velocity is set to zero. When the predefined interval has ended the method can move to block535if the slope approached zero for the predefined interval or can return to block531if the slope did not approached zero for the predefined interval.

At block535, the method can detect a quick stop. For example, when the smooth gyro data is within the threshold and when the slope of the smooth gyro data approached zero during the predefined interval a quick stop is detected. When a quick stop is detected, method530can end.

Sensors615can be distributed on platform170in concentric circles609,610,611and612. In another embodiments platform170can be divided into two or more regular polygons. In another embodiment, platform170can be divided into a center area and adjoining trapezoidal areas. In still another embodiment, platform170can be divided into a square symmetric XY grid. Platform170can further be divided into two or more slices. For example, as shown inFIG.37, platform170can be divided into 8 slices,601,602,603,604,605,606,607, and608. One or more sensors615can be located within the cross-section of each concentric circle and each slice. For example, sensor615A can be located within the cross-section of the inner most concentric circle609and slice601. Sensors615B can be located within the cross-section of concentric circle611and slice601. In another embodiment, the cross-section of the inner most concentric circle609and slice601can include two or more sensors. In another embodiment, each cross-section of a concentric circle and slice can include two or more sensors.

For example, sensors615can be of a smaller size when located near the center of platform170and progressively larger the further from the center of platform170the sensors615are located. In another embodiment, the sensors can be of equivalent size, for example, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 or 5.5 inches or any other size in diameter.

In another embodiment, the threshold value as a by-pass filter, wherein only capacitances above the threshold are used in calculating the direction vector and speed vector of approximately 2 to 3 degrees.

At block854, one or more sensors in an outer ring can change from off to on.

At blocks864, the computer system can check the point-in-time sensor scan of one or more of the sensors located in one or more adjacent middle rings in the same section of platform170.

The velocity vector generated inFIGS.41and42can be used to calculate a variety of gaming metrics, for example, speed, direction, walking, running, jumping. The velocity vector output can be (X,Y) coordinates indicating direction and magnitude (speed) of the user's foot or feet.

Velocity vectors can be generated using (X,Y) position coordinates of one or more sensors in which a change is registered, as shown inFIGS.41and42For example, XY sensor plane of the locomotion system platform170, can stretch from a designated −1 to 1 distance units in each quadrant of a two dimensional plane. The coordinates can be normalized to facilitate ease of future vector calculations. For example, by dividing the both the X and Y coordinates by normalization factor, in an embodiment (X2+Y2)1/2. Before velocity vectors are transmitted to computer system635, MCU625can translate the coordinates from a (−1, 1) range to a (0, 255) range.

A vector speed representation can be calculated by multiplying normalized coordinates by a speed value, for example, a value between 0 and 1. The resulting vector “length” can represent the speed. In another embodiment, vector speed calculations can be performed based on a frequency of user steps. In another embodiment, a time interval between activation of consecutive or adjacent sensors can be used to determine the vector speed. For example, using the saved sensor time stamp data.

In an embodiment, a velocity vector calculation can be used to calculate a user jump. For example, using the inner ring sensors and time stamp data of the center sensors to calculate activation and deactivation of the each foot. In another embodiment, the inner, middle and outer sensors can be used to calculate a forward, sideways, and backwards jump.

FIG.43illustrates a flow chart of an example method900for performing velocity vector integration, with a third party system, for example, a third party gaming system.FIG.43is a flow diagram illustrating an example method900for velocity vector integration with a third party. Method900illustrated inFIG.43is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the method. Additionally, while the example methods is illustrated with a particular order of steps, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate thatFIG.43and the steps illustrated therein can be executed in any order that accomplishes the technical advantages of the present disclosure and can include fewer or more steps than illustrated.

Each block shown inFIG.43represents one or more processes, methods or subroutines, carried out in example method. The steps illustrated inFIG.43can be implemented in a system including at least platform170. Each block shown inFIG.43can be carried out by at least a platform170. In another embodiment, the sensors can be located on a user or an accessory.

Method900begins at block902. At block902a relative velocity vector input can be received. Subsequently, an angle of the vector input is computed. The angle computed can be the angle measure between the velocity vector direction and absolute north, the front of platform170. At block904, if the angle of the velocity vector input is 0, then a previous vector quantity905is used. In an embodiment, if after receiving 0 vectors for 1/10thsecond, the vector is reset to 0. At block906, if the angle of the velocity vector input is less than 30 degrees, the forward motion direction at block907is used. At block908, if the angle of the velocity vector input is between 30 and 80 degrees, a 45 degree motion selection at block909is made, for example, in either the left or right direction. At block910, if the angle of velocity vector input is between 80 and 90 degrees, a 90 degree motion at block911selection is made, for example, in either the left or right direction. At block912, if the angle of the velocity vector input is greater than 90 degrees, a backstep motion at block913is made vector is reset to 0.

Current video games use a relative orientation framework. Pushing a joystick to the right or pressing “D” on a keyboard can move a user's avatar 90 degrees to the right from a current viewpoint or camera position. In one embodiment, the current camera position can be obtained by measuring a direction of a head mounted display (e.g., a virtual reality headset). Thus in the relative orientation framework, movement can be relative to the current camera position. To further illustrate, pushing the joystick up or “W” on the keyboard can move the user's avatar in the forward in the current camera position.

In an example embodiment, a game can use an absolute orientation framework (decoupled framework). When a game is played using platform170, the user's avatar can move independently from the current viewpoint or camera position. The user's avatar can move in an absolute manner relative to an in-game map. For example, if the user walks the direction north on platform170, the user's avatar can move north on the in-game map, regardless of the current camera position. In a related aspect, the head mounted display can include a magnetometer. The magnetometer can use an absolute orientation framework similar to platform170, wherein the current in-game camera position can be the direction the user is physically looking outside the game.

In an embodiment, the direction “north” can be magnetic north or polar north. In another embodiment, the direction “north” can be a designated direction set or calibrated at a start of a game. For example, a user wearing a head mounted display, such as a virtual reality headset, can look forward relative to the user's body during calibration, which can calibrate the current forward looking direction with a forward walking orientation prior to decoupling the current camera position and the user's body position. In another embodiment, the halo or harness attached to platform170, can include sensors to calibrate the forward position of a user with the forward orientation in-game prior to decoupling the current camera position and the user's body position. In another embodiment, upon initiation of a game the current position of the user outside of the game, determined by the sensors in platform170, the harness, or the headset can be calibrated to the starting position of the game. For example, if an avatar is initiated facing east, then the direction the user is facing when the game is initiated can be calibrated east.

In an example embodiment, decoupling can be implemented in existing games. Existing games are not set up for decoupling, however the decoupling effect can still be achieved by generating one or more keystrokes based on the user's current camera position. For example, if the user walks forward on the platform170while looking 90 degrees to the left, decoupling can be accomplished by generating the “D” key or left movement key. The absolute orientation framework can be converted to the relative orientation framework by taking into account the current camera direction. In another example, if the user walks forward on the platform170while looking 45 degrees to the right, achieving the decoupling effect can be accomplished by generating the “W” and “A” keys simultaneously or in an alternating manner. In yet another example, if the user walks forward on the platform170while looking 15 degrees to the right, achieving the decoupling effect can be accomplished by generating the more “W” keys than “A” keys.

In an embodiment, the sensors can monitor directions of a user's left foot and right foot to determine the user's intended movement direction.FIG.44illustrates an example algorithm for determining a step direction. In an embodiment, four active sensors can be physically located on one or more slices of platform170, for example, the sensors are located in slice601and rings611and612. The four active sensors can represent all non-zero sensors in the outer two sensor rings. Each of the four active sensors can have a position vector value and a capacitance value. A threshold can be used to filter out sensor capacitance readings below pre-defined threshold value. This can reduce the noise in determining a single step is completed. For example, if the threshold value is specified as a capacitance value of 0.50, then only sensors having a reading of greater than 0.50 can be used is determining the step direction. In another embodiment, the active sensors can be physically located on a user's feet, hands, torso, head, or an accessory, for example a gun, sword, baton, paddle, or bat.

FIG.44illustrates a flow chart of an example method1000for determining a user's intended movement direction.FIG.44is a flow diagram illustrating an example method1000for determining a user's intended movement direction. Method1000illustrated inFIG.44is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the method. Additionally, while the example methods is illustrated with a particular order of steps, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate thatFIG.44and the steps illustrated therein can be executed in any order that accomplishes the technical advantages of the present disclosure and can include fewer or more steps than illustrated.

Each block shown inFIG.44represents one or more processes, methods or subroutines, carried out in example method. The steps illustrated inFIG.44can be implemented in at least a system including a platform170. Each block shown inFIG.44can be carried out by at least a platform170. In another embodiment, the sensors can be located on the user or accessory.

Method1000can begin at block1001. At block1001, one or more sensors can be activated by recording a measurement. In an embodiment, sensors on platform170can be activated by recording a capacitance measurement. For example, if a user steps forward to the outer two rings of slice601, the four sensors in rings611and612can have capacitance readings. If the capacitance readings of the sensors are greater than a predefined threshold, the capacitance readings can be used to calculate the step direction. In an embodiment all sensor readings greater than zero can be used in calculating the step direction. In another embodiment, sensors can be activated by recording an inertial measurement or optical measurement. When a sensor value has been recorded at one or more sensors, the method can proceed to block1002.

At block1002, the active sensors with a recorded value greater than or equal to threshold can be normalized. During the normalization process, the position of one or more sensors can be converted to one or more direction vectors. For example, if the active sensors are in slice601, the normalized direction vectors can be in the direction of slice601. When the normalization of the sensor positions has completed, the method can proceed to block1003.

At block1003, weighted vectors can be calculated for the normalized position vectors. In an embodiment, the weighted vectors by capacitance can be calculated. For example, sensors with a greater capacitance reading can be assigned a higher weight. In an embodiment the weight of each active sensor is calculated by multiplying the normalized position vectors by the sensor capacitance values. When the vectors have been weighted the method can move to block1003.

At block1004, the weighted vectors can be accumulated to calculate an accumulated vector. For example, the directionally weighted vectors can be added together to calculate an accumulated vector. When an accumulated vector has been calculated the method can move to block1005.

At block1005, the accumulated vector can be normalized. For example, normalizing the accumulated vector can determine the step direction vector. When the accumulated vectors have been normalized and the step direction vector created method1000can end.

FIG.45is a flow diagram illustrating an example method1050for determining a user's intended movement direction. In another embodiment the method can track two-step direction vectors and calculate the velocity direction as the average of the two vectors. The method can determine a velocity for a user's character movement based on even and odd step direction vectors and step time stamps, for example, averaging direction vectors and monitoring step rate. The method can store a set of internal or global data structures, for example: Vector3, Float, Int, Bool, vStep[2], timeStep[2], nSteps, and is Step.

Method1050illustrated inFIG.45is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out the method. Additionally, while the example methods is illustrated with a particular order of steps, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate thatFIG.45and the steps illustrated therein can be executed in any order that accomplishes the technical advantages of the present disclosure and can include fewer or more steps than illustrated.

Each block shown inFIG.45represents one or more processes, methods or subroutines, carried out in example method. The steps illustrated inFIG.45can be implemented in at least a system including a platform170. Each block shown inFIG.45can be carried out by at least a platform170. In another embodiment, the sensors can be located on the user or accessory.

Method1050can begin at block1052. At block1052an event can occur, for example, a current time, position an inertial, optical or capacitance measurement of one or more sensors. When an event has occurred, the method can proceed to block1054. At block1054, the sensors can be zeroed. In an embodiment, the sensors in a center zone of platform170can be zeroed. In an embodiment, the center zone can be the inner two rings of platform170. In another embodiment center zone can a geometric shape, a circle, hexagon or octagon. When the sensors have been set to zero, method1050can proceed to block1056.

At block1056, a threshold can be used to filter active sensors. In an embodiment, a threshold can be used to filter active sensors based on capacitance, optical measurements, or inertial measurements. For example, if the capacitance readings of the active sensors are greater than a predefined threshold, the active sensor can be included in the velocity calculation. In an embodiment the threshold can be set to zero. When the active sensors with a capacitance reading greater than or equal to threshold value are determine, the method can proceed to block1058. At block1058, a step direction vector is calculated. For example, the step direction vector can be calculated using method1000. When the step direction vector is calculated method1050can proceed to block1060.

At block1060, the length of the direction vector is determined. If the length of the direction vector is greater than zero, method1050can proceed to a block1062. At block1062, it is determined if a user has taken a step. For example, an active sensor reading outside of the center zone can be a confirmation of a step. If it is determined a step was taken, method1050can proceed to a block1080. At block1080the velocity can be calculated. In an embodiment, the velocity can be a vector which is the average of two-step direction vectors multiplied by the step rate or speed. In the same embodiment, the magnitude of the velocity vector is the user speed. A zero length vector can mean the user is stopped. A vector length between 0 and 1 can mean the user is walking or running. A vector length of 1 can mean the user is running. The velocity can be calculated, in an embodiment, using Equations (1)-(3).
time=clamp(abs(timeStep[0]−timeStep[1]),minTime,maxTime)  Equation (1)
speed=1.0f−(time−speedRunning)/(speedSlow−speedrunning)  Equation (2)
vVelocity=normalize(vStep[0]+vStep[1])*speed  Equation (3)

Once the velocity is calculated at block1080, the method can proceed to block1082and end.

If at block1062a step was not taken, the method can proceed to block1064. At block1064, a step is recorded. For example, the direction vector has a length greater than zero (block1060) and the sensors in center zone were zeroed out (block1054), therefore a foot has moved to the outer sensors. When a step is recorded, method1050can move to block1080to calculate a velocity. Once the velocity is calculated at block1080.

If at block1060, the length of the direction vector is equal to or less than zero, method1050can proceed to a block1070. At block1070, it is determined if a user has taken a step. For example, an active sensor reading outside of the center zone, a step has been taken. If it is determined a step was taken, method1050can proceed to a block1072. At block1072, the number of steps is incremented and a step variable is set to false. For example, there was in a step (foot in outer sensors) and now there is no foot detected in the outer sensors, thus step is complete. After the step is completed, method1050can proceed to block1080.

If at block1070, a step was not taken, the method can proceed to block1074. At block1074, it can be determined if step was too slow. In an embodiment, if a foot stayed in an outer zone of platform170. In an embodiment, a step being too slow can be determined by subtracting the current time from the previous step time and then determining if the calculated value is greater or less than a step threshold value. If the step is too slow then method1050can proceed to block1076. At block1076, the steps values are reset. For example, number of steps, step vector and step time can be set to zero. When the step values are set to zero method1050can proceed to block1080. If at block1074a step was not too slow, method1050can proceed to block1080.

FIGS.46A,46B, and46Cillustrate an example industrial omnidirectional locomotion system. Industrial omnidirectional locomotion system1100can comprise vertical supports1101, horizontal struts1102, halo134, support members1103and1104, platform170, vertical poles1105, springs1106, ground supports1107and a linear ball bearing system (not shown).

Vertical supports1101can enable vertical movement of halo134. In an embodiment, vertical supports1101can be hollow to enable entry of horizontal struts1102and coupling to vertical poles1105by a linear ball bearing system. Vertical supports1101can be of variable length. Vertical supports1101can also include a protective covering. The protective covering can prevent foreign materials from entering the hollow portion of Vertical supports1101and thus prevent foreign materials from interfering with linear ball bearing system, pole1105and springs1106. For example, the protective covering can be overlapping bristles. In an embodiment, the vertical supports1101are far enough away from the center support to prevent interference with a user and any industrial gear, for example a gun, sword, baton, paddle, racquet. Vertical supports1101can keep vertical poles1105, vertical for example, 90 degree angle, to enable consistent vertical movement from the user. Horizontal struts1102extend from halo134and attached to the vertical poles1105by a ball bearing system. The ball bearing system can enable vertical movement of halo134. In another embodiment, horizontal struts1102can also extend at an acute angle, for example, 75 degrees, 45 degrees, or any other angle less than 90 degrees, as shown inFIG.46C. A more acute angle can enable an industrial user unobstructed use of an industrial firearm, for example pointing the barrel on the gun towards the ground. In an embodiment, the ball bearing system can have greater than 5 inches of contact with the vertical poles. The linear ball bearing system can comprise a linear ball bearing block. The liner ball bearing system can enable a smoother movement of the struts1102along the vertical poles. Horizontal struts1102can extend from halo134in the same plane. Support members1103and1104can add stability to vertical supports1101. Ground support1107can support and stabilize industrial omnidirectional locomotion system1100.

Springs1106can raise the halo134and struts150when a user is in the standing position. Springs1106can provide support during forward user movements. Springs1106can further compress enabling a user to crouch, and aid a user in standing, standing up from a crouch, or jumping by uncompressing. The spring constant can be calculated, in an embodiment, using Hooke's Law. The total force can be the weight of the halo can be added to the upward force needed to provide stability for a user. The stability can differ depending on the height of a user. The total force can be divided by the number of vertical supports. In an embodiment, the spring constant can be between 0.2 lb/in and 4.0 lb/in. In another embodiment, the spring constant can be between0.4lb/in and2.0lb/in.

In an embodiment, vertical supports can include telescoping poles. In another embodiment vertical supports are telescoping poles. For example, the height of the vertical supports/telescoping poles will be the same height as halo. The telescoping pole can enable a user to move vertically by compressing and extending in response to the user's movements.

In an embodiment, the vertical supports can be a bungee cord or suspended spring system. In this embodiment, a minimal resistance would be applied to the halo when a user is in the crouch position. Upon a user moving to the stand position from the crouch position, the resistance on the halo would subside. In another embodiment, vertical movement can be achieved by a pivot arm system. A pivot can be attached to the struts on either the vertical support or the halo. Upon a user moving to the crouch or stand position, the pivots can actuate enabling the vertical movement of the user. In another embodiment, vertical movement can be achieved by a magnetic levitation system. The struts can be attached to the vertical support by magnets. The magnetic field created by the magnetic polarization can enable vertical movement. In another embodiment, vertical movement can be achieved by hydraulic actuation. The horizontal struts can be attached to the vertical supports by hydraulics. Vertical movement of the user can be actuated by the hydraulics. In another embodiment, vertical movement can be achieved by compressed gas. Vertical movement can be achieved by actuating a regulator causing the release and restriction of the flow of compressed gas.

FIG.47is a cross-sectional view illustrating a pulley braking system of an industrial omnidirectional locomotion system. A pulley system1120can connect a mass1122to a linear bearing system (not shown) by a cable1121. The mass1122can enable the linear bearing system to move vertically along a vertical pole1105. The mass can provide a constant upward horizontal force to the horizontal struts1102and halo (not shown). The constant upward horizontal force can counteract the constant downward force produced when a user is moving forward, for example walking or running. In the previous and subsequent embodiments, the forward force can also be a backward force, for example, a user walking for running backward.

FIG.48is a cross-sectional view illustrating a counter weight system braking system of an industrial omnidirectional locomotion system. A counterweight system can aid in preventing a user from falling. In an embodiment, the counterweight system can comprise vertical supports1101, vertical poles1105, and one or more springs1106used to create a restorative force to resist horizontal force provided by the user. The springs1106can be placed underneath a linear bearing system (not shown). The springs1106can compress due to downward horizontal force, produced by a user forward movement, which can also produce a balancing upward force, for example if a user is walking or running.

FIG.49is a top view illustrating a frictional force braking system of an industrial omnidirectional locomotion system. The forces produced by a forward movement of a user can be converted into a frictional force that can resist the vertical force of a falling user. The frictional force can counteract the constant downward force produced by a forward movement of a user, for example running. In an embodiment, the frictional force is created by a frictional material1123internal to the vertical supports1101and the bearing system (not shown). When a user moves forward the frictional material on the outside of the bearing system comes into contact with the frictional material internal to the hollow supports creating a frictional force.

FIG.50is a top view illustrating a circumferential spring braking system of an industrial omnidirectional locomotion system. The linear ball bearing system can be attached to the vertical pole by one or more springs1124. In an embodiment, four springs1124are set equidistant and creating a 90 degrees with the vertical pole1105. When a forward movement is applied by the user to the horizontal strut1102, the horizontal force is transferred from the user through the horizontal strut1102and to the springs1124. When the springs compress, the frictional material on the outside of the linear ball bearing system and internal to the hollow support come into contact creating a frictional force. The frictional force can resist the downward force produced by the forward movement of the user, preventing a fall. In another embodiment, the frictional force can come from the contact of the strut and the linear bearing system.

FIG.51illustrates a cable braking system of an industrial omnidirectional locomotion system. A cable braking system can be used to prevent a user from falling. The cable braking system can include brakes1127, brake cables1125that run along the horizontal struts1102, and a ball bearing sleeve1126which houses the bearing system. The forward movement of a user can create a horizontal force. The horizontal force can actuate and increase the tension on brake cables1125actuating the brakes1127. For example, the increased tension on the cable brake system can provide a frictional force along the vertical pole, resisting the downward force produced by a user's forward movement, for example walking or running.

FIG.52illustrates a Pouch Attachment Ladder System (PALS) and a modular lightweight load-carrying equipment (MOLLE) harness connection. Standard industrial load bearing equipment can be integrated to the harness120. In an embodiment, MOLLE personal protective equipment with PALS1130can be integrated, as shown inFIG.52. In another example, a MOLLE patrol pack with PALS can be integrated. The PALS system consists of a webbing grid1129for connecting PALS compatible equipment. Any other industrial gear or attire, for example, improved load bearing equipment (ILBE), can also be integrated into the locomotion system harness. Harness120can have one or more PALS compatible straps1128for integration with industrial equipment, for example MOLLE or ILBE. Compatible straps1128can be attached to the MOLLE person protective equipment1130, the MOLLE patrol pack, the ILBE equipment by the PALS system.

The present invention relates generally to compositions for use in biological and chemical separations, as well as other applications. More specifically, the present invention relates to hybrid felts that are fabricated from electrospun nanofibers with high permeance and high capacity.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Microfiber and nanofiber membranes, or “felts”, have a variety of different uses for both biological and industrial applications. For example, felts are useful in providing for textile reinforcement, protective clothing, catalytic media, agricultural applications, sensors for environmental, medical, and military monitoring, biomedical applications (e.g., bioseparations, tissue engineering and wound dressings), electronic applications (e.g., capacitors, transistors and diodes), and space applications (e.g., solar sails and backing structure for space mirrors). Microfiber and nanofiber felts are particularly well suited for purifying biological substances, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, bacteria, viruses, cells, and the like. They are useful in all fluid applications, both liquid and gaseous.

The biopharmaceutical therapeutics industry is expanding as more and more biopharmaceuticals are approved for sale. In addition, biologically based diagnostic tools are widely used to perform high throughput, sensitive diagnostic testing of various disease states. For both therapeutics and diagnostics, biological substances (e.g., recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, viral vaccines, and nucleic acids) must be efficiently produced and purified for use.

Conventional purification methodologies include the separation of desired biological substances from byproducts and other contaminants using, for example, packed microbeads for adsorption/chromatography, ultrafiltration, and precipitation/crystallization. These conventional separation methods provide adequate results for many biological applications, but are limited in terms of yield, processing time and degree of purity. These limitations are primarily due to slow diffusion rates of relatively large biomolecules, which limits the ability of the substance being purified (i.e., the “target substance”) to access available binding sites deep within the separation matrix. In addition, these systems can only be used for a limited number of cycles, and some can only be used once.

Ion-exchange (IE) and hydrophobic interaction (HI) adsorption/chromatography are two examples of more robust conventional separation technologies that are widely used for separation of biological substances. They are generally less efficient overall than separation technologies based on specific affinity, such as antibody-based separations, but if separation conditions are carefully selected, they are still useful for purifying many target substances from undesirable byproducts and impurities.

While affinity-based adsorption/chromatography may be more efficient than IE and HI, it is generally more difficult and expensive to manufacture, because of the complexity of producing and purifying biological ligands, such as monoclonal antibodies and nucleic acids. Such ligands are also often very sensitive to environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, ionic strength, etc.) and can easily become deteriorated such that the affinity interaction required for adsorption is destroyed. In addition, the binding interaction is sometimes difficult to disrupt without harsh conditions that may lessen the biological activity and hence the usefulness of the target substance and/or the reusability of the purification media.

Membranes that are useful for purification of biological substances have been described. (See, e.g., Bioprocessing for Value-Added Products from Renewable Resources, Shang-Tian Yang, Ed., Chapter 7.) Recently, membrane adsorption/chromatography using nanometer diameter fibers constructed into mats of controlled thickness (i.e., “nanofiber felts”) has shown great promise for use in bioseparations (Todd J. Menkhaus, et al., “Chapter 3: Applications of Electrospun Nanofiber Membranes for Bioseparations”, in Handbook of Membrane Research, Stephan V. Gorley, Ed.) Such nanofiber felts are superior to microfiber felts, because pore sizes, affinity characteristics, as well as other performance criteria, can be more precisely controlled.

While previously described single component nanofiber felts have provided promising results, they are often less efficient than would be desirable in terms of stability of the felts, as well as material and time requirements. This is particularly true when the target substance is only present in the starting material to be purified at a low concentration, and contaminants and/or the byproducts of synthesis are abundant. Thus, there exists a need to improve the stability of the felts and the purification efficiency of biological products. The embodiments disclosed below satisfy that need.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The following simplified summary provides a basic understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview, and is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented below.

In one embodiment, the present invention is an electrospun hybrid nanofiber felt that is formed from a composite nanofiber and a single component nanofiber. The composite nanofiber may be electrospun from a mixture of derivatized cellulose and a first non-cellulose-based polymer, while the single component nanofiber may be electrospun from a second non-cellulose-based polymer, which may be the same or different from the first non-cellulose-based polymer. Usually, the first and second non-cellulose-based polymers are differentially removable from the nanofiber felt, which means that conditions exist (either using solvents or heat, or a combination of solvent and heat) that result in one of the non-cellulose-based polymers being removed to a greater extent than the other (e.g., 10% difference in removability, or more, such as 20% or 50%.)

The derivatized cellulose in the composite nanofiber may be an organic ester of cellulose, an inorganic ester of cellulose, or an alkylcellulose. The organic ester of cellulose may be cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, or cellulose proprionate.

When the derivatized cellulose is an inorganic ester, it may be cellulose nitrate and cellulose sulfate, and when it is an alkylcellulose, it may be hydroxyethyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose.

The first non-cellulose-based polymer may be a synthetic or natural polymer, such as a vinyl polymer, a polyether, an acrylic polymer, a polyester, a polycarbonate, a polyurethane, a polysaccharide (e.g., starch or chitin), a polyamide (e.g., protein or gelatin), polylactide, polyglycolide, or a copolymer thereof.

In one embodiment, the second non-cellulose-based polymer that forms the single component nanofiber is a synthetic polymer, such as a vinyl polymer, a polyamide, a polyimide, a polyester, or a copolymer thereof.

In another embodiment, the present invention is an electrospinning method of making the above-described nanofiber felt that can be described in the following steps: a) separately preparing a composite polymer spin dope and a single component polymer spin dope; b) placing the spin dopes in two different spinnerets; c) applying voltage to each spin dope with an electrode; d) separately electrospinning composite and single component nanofibers from the spinnerets; and e) collecting the solidified nanofibers as either randomly overlaid or partially aligned nanofiber felt.

The nanofiber felt as formed can be further processed by regenerating the derivatized cellulose in the composite nanofiber (i.e., converting it back to cellulose). The method of making the nanofiber felt may also include the additional steps of removing some or all of the non-cellulose-based first polymer from the composite nanofiber. Alternatively or in addition to these steps, the method of making the nanofiber felt may also include the step of surface functionalization of one or more of the polymer nanofibers in the nanofiber felt. Such surface functionalization may entail attachment of an affinity ligand that has specific affinity for a particular target molecule to be purified from a fluid.

In yet another embodiment, the present invention is a method of purifying biomolecules from a fluid that can be described in the following steps: preparing a nanofiber felt according to the method just described; b) flowing the fluid through the nanofiber felt; and recovering the biomolecules from the nanofiber felt.

Other aspects of the invention are found elsewhere in the specification.

The present invention relates generally to hybrid felts composed of electrospun nanofibers used, for example, for chemical and biological separations. The hybrid nanofiber felts have a high separation capacity and provide reproducible performance over multiple cycles under both high flow and high pressure. Such nanofiber felts exhibit complex interconnected, three-dimensional porous structures and relatively large surface areas.

In particular, the hybrid nanofiber felts are composed of more than one polymer type (i.e., they are “hybrid” felts.)

The felts of the present invention are composed of more than one polymer type (i.e., they are “hybrid” felts.) This includes hybrid felts made from a combination of single component nanofibers and “composite” nanofibers (e.g., the nanofibers are made from a mixture of two or more materials) into the “hybrid” felt. For the “composite” nanofiber, the “backbone polymer” is a derivatized cellulose, and the first non-cellulosic polymer is capable of being removed from the fiber/felt by exposing it to an elevated temperature or chemical solvents, or both an elevated temperature and chemical solvents. In some embodiments, the removal of the first non-cellulosic polymer simultaneously converts the derivatized cellulose back to cellulose, i.e., the cellulose is “regenerated.”

The nanofibers in the felts of the present invention are manufactured using an electrospinning technique. This refers to the manufacture of fibers based on exposure of an extruded polymer “spin dope” to an electrostatic field which results in elongation of the extruded polymer “jet” into a nanofiber.

These and other exemplary aspects of the invention are explained in greater detail below.

Derivatized Cellulose

Cellulose is the structural component found in the cell walls of plants and algae. It is also secreted by some bacteria. As such, cellulose is the most abundant organic compound on Earth. It is derived from D-glucose units linked together into a straight chain polymer via β(1-4) glycosidic bonds. For biological and industrial applications, it is purified from plants, wood pulp or cotton, and converted into many useful substances, such as paper, cellophane, rayon, biofuels, etc. The usefulness of cellulose can largely be attributed to its physical properties. It is odorless, hydrophilic, relatively insoluble, exhibits very low non-specific binding, and it is biodegradable.

While cellulose-based separation media have many advantages, they unfortunately suffer from being chemically unstable (i.e., they degrade) in strong acids and bases. Additionally, the dissolution of cellulose requires the use of special solvent mixtures such as N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) and water, or lithium chloride and N,N-dimethylacetamide. This limits the use of cellulose-based media to operations that do not require harsh regeneration conditions, which are often required in the biopharmaceutical industry to meet strict cleaning regulations required by the FDA.

Cellulose fibers are conventionally produced via wet spinning and involve derivatization of the cellulose beforehand, since it is very difficult to electrospin cellulose directly from solution or melt. In order to prepare cellulose nanofibers, research efforts have been dedicated to electrospinning cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose acetate. Unlike cellulose, cellulose acetate is soluble in many common solvents such as acetone. Cellulose acetate can be electrospun into nanofibers and regenerated cellulose nanofibers can be produced by subjecting the nanofibers to post-spinning treatment of hydrolysis/deacetylation.

Accordingly, in the practice of the present invention, one of the polymers in the hybrid nanofiber felt is derivatized cellulose. Cellulose can easily be derivatized using well known methods by converting the —OH group of the individual glucose units into other moieties with more or less reactivity, varying charges, etc. Such derivatized cellulose species exhibit enhanced stability when exposed to solvents and other desirable physical properties. Many cellulose derivatives are readily commercially available. Exemplary derivatized cellulose species include, for example: organic esters (cellulose acetate, triacetate, propionate, acetate propionate, acetate butyrate); inorganic esters (cellulose nitrate, cellulose sulfate); and alkyl cellulose (hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose).

The hybrid nanofiber felts of the present invention will usually have a majority by mass (i.e. 51% or greater) of derivatized cellulose, such as greater than 60% or 70%.

Non-Cellulose-Based Polymers

While the majority by mass in the hybrid nanofiber felt is derivatized cellulose, incorporation of additional types of fibers within the felts provide functionality needed for applications of the felts. Accordingly, it is desirable to have additional fibers within the felts because they can provide increased mechanical strength to the felt, allow for multiple functionalities to be incorporated into the felt, provide stability to the manufacturing process, and other aspects as explained elsewhere herein. Indeed, it was unexpectedly discovered by the present inventors that including even a small proportion of non-cellulosic-based polymers in the hybrid nanofiber felt improved the electrospinning process and also allowed for tailoring of the finished product for a variety of biological and industrial applications, especially when the hybrid nanofiber felt consisted of both a composite nanofiber and a single component nanofiber.

Synthetic polymer nanofibers (e.g., those produced from vinyl polymers and acrylic polymers) offer a wide range of chemical functionalities for bioseparations and other applications. By combining different polymeric units, the surface chemistry of the resulting fiber can be controlled as part of the electrospinning process, providing direct functionality to the produced nanofiber. As an alternative, and similar to conventional micrometer scale fibers, the surface functionality of polymer nanofibers can be chemically modified post-electrospinning to accommodate specific functionality requirements for various bioseparation applications (discussed below). Functionalization chemistries are well known in the polymer arts. They also generally withstand harsh cleaning regimens associated with bioprocesses. Exemplary functionalization chemistries are also discussed in more detail elsewhere herein.

Synthetic carbon-based adsorptive media and filtration membranes are often much more chemically robust than cellulose-based media, and thus can be used when strong acids and bases are required for cleaning the separation media between uses. Furthermore, hybrid nanofibers that include both cellulose-based and non-cellulose-based polymers (e.g., polyacrylonitrile and polyvinyl alcohol) exhibit even higher specific surface area and greater mechanical strength when compared to single component cellulose or single component synthetic polymer nanofibers. Accordingly, there is an observable synergy when composite nanofibers include both cellulose and non-cellulose-based polymers.

Many polymers have been successfully electrospun into nanofibers, including (1) thermoplastic homopolymers such as vinyl polymers, acrylic polymers, polyamides, polyesters, polyethers, and polycarbonates, (2) thermoplastic copolymers such as vinyl-co-vinyl polymers, acrylic-co-acrylic copolymers and vinyl-coacrylic polymers, (3) elastomeric polymers such as triblock copolymer elastomers, polyurethane elastomers, and ethylene-propylene-diene-elastomers, (4) high performance polymers such as polyimides and aromatic polyamides, (5) liquid crystalline polymers such as poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) and polyaramid, (6) textile polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyacrylonitrile, (7) electrically conductive polymers such as polyaniline, as well as (8) biocompatible polymers (i.e. “biopolymers”) like polycaprolactone, polylactide, chitosan and polyglycolide. As described, the polymer may also be a copolymer of two or more of the above-named polymer species.

Examples of the additional polymers that can be added into the hybrid nanofiber felts are electrospun as single component nanofibers from polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyimides, polyamides (nylon 6, nylon 6,6, nylon 6,10, etc.), polyesters (polyethylene terephthalate, etc.), as well as copolymers thereof.

Composite Nanofibers

In one embodiment of the present invention, the hybrid nanofiber felt includes a composite nanofiber. This is partly due to the fact that the electrospinning process used to make nanofibers from single component derivatized cellulose solutions can be unstable and result in poor yields, low efficiency (long times and many interruptions), poor quality nanofibers (large size distribution, fragile, etc.) with only a single chemical functionality. Therefore, in order to efficiently make large quantities of high quality nanofiber felts with multiple functionalities, it may also be necessary to combine a cellulose derivative with a non-cellulose-based polymer that stabilizes the electrospinning process.

The non-cellulose-based polymer of the composite nanofibers of the present invention may consist of synthetic carbon-based polymers that are removable from the nanofiber felt by exposing it to an elevated temperature and/or solvents. Exposure of the nanofiber felt to either a mixture of solvents or a combination of elevated temperature and solvents can occur simultaneously or sequentially. The presence of the non-cellulose-based polymer during the electrospinning process also enhances nanofiber stability and other aspects of the process, as explained elsewhere herein.

Synthetic polymer nanofibers (e.g., those produced from vinyl polymers and acrylic polymers) offer a wide range of chemical functionalities for bioseparation applications. By combining different polymeric units, the surface chemistry of the resulting fiber can be controlled as part of the electrospinning process, providing direct functionality to the produced nanofiber. As an alternative, and similar to conventional micrometer scale fibers, the surface functionality of polymer nanofibers can be chemically modified post-electrospinning to accommodate specific functionality requirements for various bioseparation applications (discussed below). Synthetic polymer nanofibers offer a tremendous range of potential functionalization chemistries to serve a wide variety of uses. Such functionalization chemistries are well known in the polymer arts. They also generally withstand harsh cleaning regimens associated with bioprocesses.

Many polymers have been successfully electrospun into nanofibers, including (1) thermoplastic homopolymers such as vinyl polymers, acrylic polymers, polyamides, polyesters, polyethers, and polycarbonates, (2) thermoplastic copolymers such as vinyl-co-vinyl polymers, acrylic-co-acrylic copolymers and vinyl-coacrylic polymers, (3) elastomeric polymers such as triblock copolymer elastomers, polyurethane elastomers, and ethylene-propylene-diene-elastomers, (4) high performance polymers such as polyimides and aromatic polyamides, (5) liquid crystalline polymers such as poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) and polyaramid, (6) textile polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyacrylonitrile, (7) electrically conductive polymers such as polyaniline, as well as (8) biocompatible polymers like polycaprolactone, polylactide, and polyglycolide.

Exemplary non-cellulose-based polymers for making composite nanofibers include, for example, polyethylene oxide, poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl alcohol), polysaccharides (chitin, starch, etc.), polystyrene, and poly(methyl methacrylate).

The non-cellulose-based polymer is normally present in the composite nanofibers in an amount of 49% or less by mass, such as 30%, 25%, etc.

Electrospinning

Electrospinning is a technique that utilizes electric forces alone to drive the spinning process and to produce polymer fibers from solutions or melts. Unlike conventional spinning techniques (e.g. solution- and melt-spinning), which are capable of producing fibers with diameters in the micrometer range (approximately 5˜25 μm), electrospinning is capable of producing fibers with diameters in the nanometer range. Electrospun polymer nanofibers possess many extraordinary properties including the small fiber diameter and the concomitant large specific surface area, the high degree of macromolecular orientation and the resultant superior mechanical properties. Additionally, felts made of electrospun polymer nanofibers exhibit controlled pore sizes when compared to nanofibers that are made using other fabrication techniques. Unlike nanorods, nanotubes and nanowires that are produced mostly by synthetic methods, electrospun nanofibers are produced through a “nano-manufacturing process”, which results in low-cost nanofibers that are also relatively easy to assemble and process into applications.

In general, the formation of nanofibers is a delicate and complicated balance of three major forces involved in the electrospinning process, including the electrical force, the surface tension, and the viscoelastic force. Among these three forces, the electrical force always favors the formation of the product with the highest surface areas. The surface tension always favors the formation of the product with the smallest surface areas. The viscoelastic force is a force which varies significantly with the evaporation of the solvent and is the main reason preventing the breakup of the electrospinning jet/filament into droplets. When the electrical force is dominant, viscoelastic force works against the electrical force. When surface tension is dominant, viscoelastic force works against surface tension.

Theoretically, the smallest nanofibers are capable of being formed under two conditions: (1) when the excess charge density carried by the electrospinning jet is high, and (2) when the time period is long enough and the viscoelastic force is high enough to prevent the capillary breakup of the jet/filament but low enough to allow the electrical force to effectively stretch the jet. For condition (1), it has been found that the addition of soluble electrolytes to the spin dope (e.g., addition of strong electrolytes such as NaCl to polyethylene oxide aqueous solution) can significantly increase the excess charge density carried by the jet and cause the formation of smaller diameter nanofibers. This method, however, also creates negative effects such as (a) a smaller flow rate and the resulting decrease in nanofibers productivity, and (b) the contamination of the prepared nanofibers by the electrolytes. The removal of the electrolytes without sacrificing the properties of nanofibers may be difficult.

For condition (2), further understanding of jet solidification is required. In general, the jet solidification is closely related to the volatility of solvent. If the solvent volatility is too high, the time period for effectively stretching the electrospinning jet/filament is short. Consequently, fibers with relatively large diameters will be obtained. If the solvent volatility is too low, the electrospinning jet/filament is likely to break up into droplets with the stretching. Consequently, beads and/or beaded fibers will be obtained.

The electrospinning process generally includes three steps: (1) initiation of the electrospinning jet/filament and the extension of the jet along a straight trajectory; (2) growth of the bending instability and the further elongation of the jet, which allows the jet to become very long and thin while following a looping and spiraling path; and (3) the solidification of the jet through solvent evaporation or cooling, which leads to the formation of nanofibers.FIG.1schematically shows the process of electrospinning (Hao Fong, In Polymeric Nanostructures and Their Applications, Volume 2: Applications: Chapter 11, Electrospun Polymer, Ceramic, Carbon/Graphite Nanofibers and Their Applications, Hari S. Nalwa Editor, American Scientific Publishers, Los Angeles, Calif. (ISBN: 1-58883-070-5), 2007, pp. 451-474.

An exemplary electrospinning process can generally be described as follows:

Step 1:

As shown inFIG.1, a spin dope (e.g., a polymer solution) is placed in a container with spinneret (1), and DC high voltage (2), usually in the range from 5-40 kilovolts, is applied to the solution through an electrode (e.g., a copper wire)(3). An electrically grounded collector (4) is placed at a certain distance (known as the gap distance)(5) away from the spinneret. The gap distance may range from a few centimeters up to one meter. When the electrostatic field reaches a critical value, and the electric force overcomes surface tension and viscoelastic forces, a jet/filament is ejected and travels straight for a certain distance (known as the jet length).

Step 2:

The jet then starts to bend, forming helical loops. This phenomenon is termed “bending (or whipping) instability.” Typically, the bending instability causes the length of a jet to elongate by more than 10,000 times in a very short time period (50 ms or less). Thus, the elongational rate during the bending instability is extremely high (up to 1,000,000 s−1). This extremely fast elongational rate can effectively stretch the chain of macromolecules and closely align them along the nanofiber axis.

Step 3:

The jet solidifies, either though evaporation of the solvent or when the melt cools below the solid-liquid transition temperature. The longer the solidification time, the more the jet can be lengthened. The solidification time is related to many factors such as solvent vapor pressure, solvent diffusivity, volumetric charge density carried by the jet, and strength of the applied electrostatic field.

Optional Post-Electrospinning Processing

After solidification of the collected nanofibers, there are certain additional steps that can be performed in order to “customize” the nanofibers for particular uses. Exemplary additional steps are discussed below:

a. Removal of the First Non-Cellulosic Polymer

In some cases, one or more of the polymers, and in particular the non-cellulose-based polymer present in a composite nanofiber, can be removed using elevated heat and/or solvent(s). Removal of the first non-cellulosic polymer provides additional surface area and improved porosity of the remaining cellulose-based polymer. This is because after removal of the non-cellulose-based polymer, the cellulose-based polymer has controlled-sized “pores” left behind where the non-cellulose-based polymer used to occupy space. This additional “void space” provides greater surface area on the resultant nanofiber felt that can, for example, increase adsorptive binding capacity for separations, improve selectivity of size-based separations, and improve throughput from additional porosity. Removing the non-cellulose-based polymer negates the opportunity for multiple functionalities (that had been present within the composite nanofiber) directly present on the remaining cellulose-based polymer nanofiber.

b. Cellulose Regeneration

Following preparation of the “as electrospun” nanofibers, the derivatized cellulose can be converted into cellulose through the process of regeneration. The regenerated cellulose will have the same properties as pure native cellulose described previously. The regeneration process is completed by contacting nanofibers containing derivatized cellulose with, for example, a strong base (e.g., sodium hydroxide), or other solvent. Following the regeneration reaction for conversion to cellulose, the nanofibers can be washed to remove any excess solvent used during the process.

c. Surface Functionalization

After the preparation of hybrid nanofiber felts, the fiber surfaces may be functionalized. Non-limiting examples of functionalization include the addition of ion-exchange groups such as weak or strong acids, and bases (e.g., carboxylic acids and amines), hydrophobic groups such as phenolic compounds, and affinity ligands such as antibodies or enzyme substrates.

For use in bioseparation, the hybrid nanofiber felts of the present invention are ideally biologically inert, meaning that they should resist non-specific binding of insoluble solids such as cells and cellular debris, as well as unwanted interactions with proteins, sugars, nucleic acids, viruses, and other soluble components present in many biologically produced systems.

In addition, nanofiber felts for use in bioseparation should exhibit several qualities: (1) small diameter fibers to allow for the largest amount of specific area (this criterion is most important for adsorption processes and less important for strictly size-based separations discussed below); (2) well controlled and narrow pore size distribution between fibers to allow for even flow distribution during adsorptive applications and for a tight size cutoff for size-based separations; (3) fibers should have excellent mechanical and chemical stability to withstand potentially high operating pressures and harsh cleaning conditions; and (4) fibers should have a well defined and spatially consistent size and chemical composition.

For adsorption processes, where macromolecular products such as proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses are the predominant targets, the extremely large specific surface area associated with nanofiber felts provides an enormous number of potential binding sites for adsorptive bioseparations. Nanofibers can be modified to contain a tremendous number of binding sites and adsorption occurs almost exclusively on the surface of the fibers, which makes the binding sites immediately available without requiring the relatively large target molecule to diffuse internally. Internal diffusion can often limit the capacity for many adsorption processes of bioproducts when using traditional porous resin beads. In addition, because the nanofiber membranes can be made from many different chemistries, the adsorption ligand can be tailored to meet the needs of a particular separation (e.g., ionic, hydrophobic, and affinity). In some cases the ligand can be incorporated into the nanofiber from the source materials during electrospinning, or alternatively the surface can be chemically modified to provide the desired adsorbing agent after producing the nanofiber.

Two of the most important characteristics of the separation operation are that, (1) flow is through micro- and macro-pores of the felt (as opposed to tightly packed resin beads), and (2) that adsorption takes place on the surface of the fibers, where no internal diffusion is required. These factors reduce concerns of high-pressure drops with elevated flow rates, and eliminate the slow intra-particle diffusion required for adsorption within resin beads. It has been shown that the binding capacity of biomolecules to currently available adsorptive felts is similar in magnitude to resin beads, but can operate at processing flow rates over 10 times faster than packed beds. These factors allow for much faster processing times and potentially higher binding levels for purifying valuable biological products. This is highly desirable, especially for large biomolecules (molecular weights greater than 250 kDa, and/or hydrodynamic diameters of 20-300 nm), because they are extremely difficult to purify using packed beds due to the severe mass transfer limitations within the small pores of resin beads.

The surface of the nanofiber felts of the present invention can be modified to provide ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chemistry. Simple chemical modification such as sulfonation of polystyrene fibers with sulfuric acid has been used to produce a cation exchange medium. Grafting, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), and plasma treatments have been used to create ion-exchange surface functional groups as well as three-dimensional tethers from a variety of polymeric substrates including polypropylene, polyvinylidene difluoride, polysulphone, and others. Phenyl and butyl groups can also be introduced as hydrophobic interaction ligands. Often times, the surface of polymer membranes must be further modified for greater hydrophilicity to discourage non-specific binding. This has been accomplished by introduction of poly(ethylene glycol) and other polyols onto the surface.

The ion exchange capacity of a hybrid nanofiber felt can also be enhanced by introducing, for example, diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) groups as a weak anion exchange ligand or carboxylic acid as a weak cation exchange ligand.

d. Surface Functionalization with Antimicrobials

In one embodiment of the present invention, the non-cellulose-based polymer is polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Fibrous membranes of PAN have been widely adopted in filtration due to thermal stability, high mechanical properties, and chemical resistivity. Electrospun PAN nanofiber felts have been of particular interest due to properties such as small fiber diameters and the concomitant large specific surface areas, as well as capabilities to control pore sizes among nanofibers and to incorporate antimicrobial agents at nanoscale. Felts consisting of nanofibers with antimicrobial functionality have attracted growing attentions due to the concerns about qualities of purified water and/or filtered air as well as the processing costs. Water and air filters (particularly those operating in the dark and damp conditions) are constantly subject to attacks from environmental microorganisms. The microorganisms (such as bacteria) that can be readily captured by the filters grow rapidly, resulting in the formation of biofilms. Consequently, the buildups of microorganisms on the filter surfaces deteriorate the qualities of purified water and/or filtered air; additionally, they also have the unfavorable effects on the flow of water and/or air.

Moreover, the contaminated filters with biofilms are difficult to clean. Usually, high pressure is required during the operation. This in turn increases the costs. Reported methods incorporate antimicrobial agents (such as N-halamine and silver ions/nanoparticles) directly into spin dopes, thus the molecules/particles of antimicrobial agents are distributed throughout the nanofibers (Xinbo Sun, Lifeng Zhang, Zhengbing Cao, Ying Deng, Li Liu, Hao Fong, and Yuyu Sun. “Electrospun Composite Nanofiber Fabrics Containing Uniformly Dispersed Antimicrobial Agents as an Innovative Type of Polymeric Materials with Superior Anti-Infective Efficacy”. ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, 2(4), 952-956, 2010.)

However, this often leads to process problems, primarily because the high content of antimicrobial agents can seriously affect the process of electrospinning and/or deteriorate the properties of the resulting nanofibers. A potential solution to these problems is to introduce antimicrobial functionality onto nanofiber surfaces after the nanofibers are produced (Lifeng Zhang, Jie Luo, Todd J. Menkhaus, Hemanthram Varadaraju, Yuyu Sun, and Hao Fong. “Antimicrobial Nano-fibrous Membranes Developed from Electrospun Polyacrylonitrile Nanofibers”. Journal of Membrane Science, 369, 499-505, 2011.)

It is known that the nitrile (—C≡N) groups in PAN can be chemically converted into amidoxime (—C(NH2)═NOH) groups. The amidoxime groups can coordinate with a wide range of metal ions including silver ions, and the coordinated silver ions can be reduced into silver nanoparticles. Both silver ions and silver nanoparticles are antimicrobial agents with high antimicrobial efficacy.

e. Other Examples

A promising alternative to packed bed chromatography and other separation technologies is the use of the hybrid nanofiber felts of the present invention as selective adsorptive membranes. This style of adsorption utilizes the nanofiber felts as the support for ligands that are used during the selective adsorption process.

Selective adsorption involves “active” surface functionalization of the hybrid nanofiber felt, which allows for direct capture (adsorption) of target substances. Such modification is simplified if the hybrid nanofiber felts include chemical moieties on their surfaces that are relatively simple to chemically modify to provide adsorption sites.

Unlike modifying nanofiber surfaces for ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction functionality, incorporating affinity ligands onto the nanofiber can be more challenging. Often, the process requires first modifying the surface to create coupling sites for immobilization of the ligand, followed by attachment of the ligand to the active site. Importantly, both the initial surface modification and the coupling of ligand should be robust as not to leach during processing.

In some cases, simple carboxyl groups from grafting methacrylic acid onto the surface can act as the active coupling site by creating a covalent amide bond between the functionalized carboxyl group and an exposed amine group on a protein ligand. Similarly, strong oxidation of cellulose (if controlled properly) can provide aldehyde groups on the fiber surface that can form a covalent attachment to primary amines of a protein (including Protein A and Protein G); especially through the amino acid lysine. In other cases, surface functionalization with a general affinity dye (e.g., Cibacron Blue, capable of binding some proteins) can be coupled directly to a cellulose nanofiber.

More elaborately, bio-active sites for protein ligand immobilization can be incorporated into the nanofiber backbone during nanofelt construction. One example of this is using poly ethylene glycol (PEG) with poly D,L lactide (PDLLA) as a block copolymer. The glycol can be coupled with biocytin (capable of affinity interaction with streptavidin fusion proteins) after electrospinning to create an affinity nanofiber. Similarly, a polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-PEG-NH2 (PLGA-b-PEF-NH2) diblock copolymer can be created containing surface aminated nanofibers for coupling with proteins using a homobifunctional coupling agent. Finally, in some cases it is possible to use intrinsic active sites associated with certain nanofiber matrices. For instance, coupling Concanavalin A (an affinity tag for lectin associated with glycol-proteins and/or other glycolconjugates) to a chitosan-based nanofiber has been successful.

Other techniques for attaching specific ligands to cellulose-based compounds and/or synthetic polymers are known in the chemical arts.

Size Based Separations

As an orthogonal purification mechanism to adsorption, sized based separations are also routinely used in downstream bioprocessing. Depth filtration and microfiltration are common operations used for clarification of fermentation broth, where cells (approximately 1˜20 μm) and cellular debris (0.1˜1 μm) are removed from the bioreactor slurry. Nanofiltration with membranes is utilized for viral clearance and/or purification of 20˜200 nm virus particles, and ultrafiltration is commonly employed for concentration and purification of proteins. In all cases several characteristics of the separation medium are desirable. First, a well defined size cut off is desired to obtain tightly controlled separations. Second, a high porosity material is needed for high throughput processing without excessive pressure requirements to minimize operating time and/or membrane area requirements. And third, chemical and physical robustness is desirable for harsh cleaning conditions and operation under moderate pressures. Nanofiber felts, because they can be produced cheaply in large quantity from mechanically and chemically strong fibers, and with a well controlled pore size among fibers (or as hollow fibers), offer tremendous opportunity as an advanced size-based separation medium. Polymer nanofibers, in general, show the least amount of nonspecific binding, but may suffer from being less chemically robust than carbon and ceramic fibers. Ceramic fibers suffer from being brittle and have the potential for large amounts of nonspecific adsorption of biomass/bio-particles with concomitant fouling, but can withstand harsh regeneration conditions.

To date, nanofiber meshes for size-based separations have primarily seen application for isolation of nanometer and micrometer scale bio-particles (or surrogates) by a depth filtration mechanism. The elevated specific surface area of the nanofibers within a filtration mat provides for a more tortuous path and greater chance to intercept a desired particle from solution while maintaining high porosity. Polymer, carbon, and ceramic nanofibers have all been evaluated and were all able to separate the desired particle size from a mixture while maintaining high fluxes. Specifically, electrospun nanofibers made from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and Nylon 6 were capable of removing polystyrene particles between 0.5˜10 Ceramic nanofiber meshes have perhaps been used most extensively. One example shows that a combination of large titanate nanofibers with smaller boehmite nanofibers were capable of very high fluxes (1000 L/m2·h) with relatively low pressure driving force (20 kPa) and could remove virtually all particles larger than 60 nm from a solution. It should be noted that many applications of micro and nano depth filtration also rely on chemical adsorption of particles to the surface, which nanofibers are easily capable of and can be manufactured to specifically adsorb a desired impurity.

Nanofelt Construction/Configuration

By utilizing fibers with diameters in the sub-micron to nanometer range (1˜1000 nm, referred to as “nanofiber” felts), the available surface area within a given bed volume for potential binding will be greatly increased, by as much as two orders of magnitude. By controlling the pore size of nanofiber felts, the pressure drop and hydrodynamic flow characteristics can also be controlled and made to be as efficient as microfiber felts.

Furthermore, the pore sizes among fibers in the felt normally have a tight pore size distribution (greater than 90% of the nanofibers fall within the range from 100 nm to 500 nm) to discourage channeling and retain only those species above a desired size cut-off for filtration operations. Finally, the nanofiber felts are usually mechanically strong enough to operate under conditions of potentially high pressure drops (up to 100 psi) and high flow rates (flux values over 30 L/(min·m2)) and chemically robust enough to withstand potentially harsh cleaning regimens (often including strong acids, bases, and organic solvents) without falling apart.

In one embodiment, the nanofiber felts consist of a composite nanofiber (one derivatized cellulose polymer plus one non-cellulose polymer) and a single component nanofiber (non-cellulose based polymer). However, as described above, the hybrid nanofelts of the present invention may be formed from a variety of combinations of polymers and nanofibers. Examples of these include, for example:A composite nanofiber felt, wherein all of the nanofibers in the felt consist of a single species of composite nanofiber made from a coextruded mixture of a backbone polymer and a first non-cellulosic polymer.A nanofiber felt consisting of at least two different single component nanofibers.A nanofiber felt consisting of at least one single component nanofiber and at least one composite nanofiber.

In addition to the above-described nanofelt configurations, the nanofelts of the present invention may also include microfibers for added stability, strength, and to tailor other physical characteristics of the felts for use in particular applications. When compared to single-component nanofiber felts, the hybrid nanofiber felts of the present invention exhibit the following exemplary improved properties:

EXAMPLES

Example 1

Preparation of Prior Art Cellulose Acetate Single Component Nanofiber Felt

A cellulose acetate single component nanofiber felt was made as described in: Handbook of Membrane Research, Chapter 3, Applications of Electrospun Nanofiber Membranes for Bioseparations, Todd J. Menkhaus, et al, Nova Science Publishers, Inc., edited by Stephan V. Gorley. Cellulose acetate (average molecular weight of ˜30,000 g/mol), NaOH, NaCl, acetone, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.). 2-(diethylamino) ethyl chloride hydrochloride (DAECH) with the purity of 98% was purchased from the Alfa Aesar Co. (Ward Hill, Mass.).

A solution of 15% (mass fraction) cellulose acetate in acetone/DMAc (mass ratio of 2/1) was prepared at room temperature. The solution was added to a syringe. The electrospinning setup included a high voltage power supply and a laboratory produced roller. During electrospinning, a positive high voltage of 15 kV was applied to the needle, and the flow rate of 1.0 mL/h was maintained using a syringe pump. Cellulose acetate nanofibers were collected as a randomly overlaid felt on the electrically grounded aluminum foil that covered the roller. A heating lamp was used to dry the nanofiber felt during electrospinning, and the felt was further dried in a vacuum oven after electrospinning. Overall, the electrospinning process was relatively unstable, with frequent interruptions at approximately 2 hour intervals. The collected cellulose acetate nanofiber felt had a thickness of approximately 225 μm and a mass per unit area of approximately 60 g/m2.

The as-electrospun cellulose acetate nanofiber felts were first hydrolyzed/deacetylated by immersion in a 0.05M NaOH aqueous solution for 24 hours. The products, referred to as regenerated cellulose nanofiber felts, were then rinsed in distilled water three times and dried in a vacuum oven at 60° C. The samples were immersed in a 15% (mass fraction) DAECH aqueous solution for 10 minutes followed by drying at 60° C. The samples were then immersed in a 0.5M NaOH aqueous solution at 90° C. for 10 min. The samples were rinsed in distilled water three times and dried at 60° C. to yield the DEAE anion-exchange cellulose nanofiber felts.

Example 2

Preparation of a Hybrid Nanofiber Felt of CA/PEO Composite Nanofibers and PAN Single Component Nanofibers

Cellulose acetate (CA), polyethylene oxide (PEO), chloroform (CHCl3), dimethylformamide (DMF), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and diethyl amino ethyl chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.).

The spin dopes of PAN and CA+PEO were prepared separately. Briefly, for the preparation of PAN spin dope, the PAN was dissolved in DMF to make a solution. For the CA+PEO spin dope, CA plus PEO in CHCl3/DMF with diethyl amino ethyl chloride was prepared.

During the electrospinning process two syringes loaded with spin dope of PAN or CA+PEO were placed in the opposite side of the laboratory produced roller. Overall, the electrospinning process was very stable and was sustainable for long periods (>48 hours), and the electrospun hybrid nanofibrous mats consisting of CA+PEO composite nanofibers and PAN nanofibers (either self-supporting or supported on medical-grade cotton gauze) was collected on the electrically grounded aluminum foil which covered the roller.

The as-electrospun CA+PEO+PAN hybrid nanofibrous mats were then annealed for 24 h to complete the phase dispersion of CA and PEO. After that, the mats was hydrolyzed/deacetylated by immersion in a NaOH aqueous solution for 24 hrs. The resulting hybrid nanofibrous mats consisting of regenerated cellulose nanofibers and PAN nanofibers were rinsed with distilled water and dried.

Table 4 below, summarizes results for the Pe number as determined for different numbers of hybrid and single component nanofiber mats and commercial regenerated cellulose felt/membrane layers. The results indicate that the nanofiber felts produced in this study had comparable hydrodynamics.

Dynamic breakthrough analyses were completed to evaluate adsorption efficiency when being operated under flow conditions. Higher capacity at a low % breakthrough would indicate a more efficient adsorbent material. The dynamic breakthrough experiments were completed using a Pall Mustang coin holder according to manufacture's recommendations. Nine layers of either the nanofiber felts or the commercial membranes were used in the analyses. All experiments were operated with an AKTA Purifier (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) with online measurement of UV-280-nm absorbance, pH, and conductivity, and controlled by Unicorn software version 5.01. Fractions were automatically collected by the system in 0.60 mL aliquots (approximately 2 bed volumes). A minimum of 10 bed volumes were used for equilibration. Step elution to 100% Buffer B (equilibration buffer with the addition of 1.0 M NaCl) was used for each experiment. For all dynamic breakthrough tests the flow rate was maintained at a value of 1.0 mL/min. Protein stock prepared at 1.5 mg/mL in buffer was loaded until 100% breakthrough was achieved. The felt was then washed with buffer for a minimum of 10 bed volumes before desorption. All eluent (flowthrough during load, wash, and elution) was collected, weighed to determine volume, and analyzed for protein concentration by UV-280-nm absorbance. Protein mass balance was then calculated based on volume loaded and all fractions collected during the process.

The ultimate practical evaluation for any adsorption system is dynamic breakthrough analysis, a combination of equilibrium binding capacity, adsorption kinetics, and system dispersion. It is also a direct application of capacity for a flow through mode of operation where the bound molecule does not need to be selectively eluted from other impurities.

Table 5 below, shows dynamic binding capacity of protein at 10% breakthrough on the nanofiber felts and the commercial regenerated cellulose adsorptive membranes. Dynamic capacity was substantially higher for the hybrid nanofiber mats compared to any other adsorption medium evaluated. In addition, elution results indicated that within experimental uncertainty, elution of protein was complete for each adsorption system, and overall mass balance showed no losses.

Improved methods and products for conducting binding assays are provided. These methods include the use of a linking agent complex that enables the user to configure an assay to meet his/her needs from a standard set of assay materials. The products and methods of the invention greatly enhance productivity and flexibility in assay development.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A substantial body of literature has been developed concerning techniques that employ binding reactions, e.g., antigen-antibody reactions, nucleic acid hybridization and receptor-ligand reactions, for the sensitive measurement of analytes of interest in samples. The high degree of specificity in many biochemical binding systems has led to many assay methods and systems of value in a variety of markets including basic research, human and veterinary diagnostics, environmental monitoring and industrial testing. The presence of an analyte of interest may be measured by directly measuring the participation of the analyte in a binding reaction. In some approaches, this participation may be indicated through the measurement of an observable label attached to one or more of the binding materials.

Commercially available assays are generally supplied in a pre-set configuration, offering the user little or no flexibility to evaluate target(s) that may be of unique interest to him or her. Such commercial panels may include target analytes that are of little or no interest and/or they may not include the desired target analyte(s). Therefore, there is a need to provide the user a flexible method to configure a user-defined multiplexed assay using a standard set of assay materials and methods.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention contemplates the following specific embodiments. Various modifications, additions and alterations may be made to embodiments described herein by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Such modifications, additions, and alterations are intended to fall within the scope of the claims.

Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. The articles “a” and “an” are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, “an element” means one element or more than one element.

The present invention provides flexible solid phase binding assay formats that allow a user or manufacturer to configure an assay based on specific user requirements. The methods and kits described herein provide a flexible platform for creating a multiplexed binding assay for a plurality of target analytes. With a support including a plurality of binding domains bearing a series of generic targeting agent complements, it is possible to configure a multiplexed assay for any set of analytes. One only needs to select which analytes will be evaluated in which binding domain and pair the appropriate binding reagents and targeting agents with each selected binding domain. Using this platform, a user can build a personalized assay panel.

Such flexible multiplexed assay formats can be achieved using the methods and products disclosed herein. For example, a method of conducting a multiplexed binding assay for a plurality of analytes of interest can be implemented using the following steps:

(a) combining, in one or more steps, the following components:(i) a sample comprising a first analyte of interest and a second analyte of interest,(ii) a first targeting agent immobilized on a first binding domain,(iii) a first targeting agent complement connected to a linking agent, wherein the first targeting agent complement is a binding partner of the first targeting agent,(iv) a first binding reagent connected to a supplemental linking agent, wherein the first binding reagent is a binding partner of the first analyte,(v) a second targeting agent immobilized on a second binding domain,(vi) a second targeting agent complement connected to a linking agent, wherein the second targeting agent complement is a binding partner of the second targeting agent,(vii) a second binding reagent connected to a supplemental linking agent, wherein the second binding reagent is a binding partner of the second analyte, and(viii) optionally, at least two copies of a bridging agent,wherein, if the bridging agent is omitted, each linking agent is a binding partner of the supplemental linking agent, or if the bridging agent is included, the bridging agent has a first binding site for one of the linking agents and an additional binding site for one of the supplemental linking agents;

(b) forming(i) a first binding complex on the first binding domain comprising the first targeting agent, the first targeting agent complement, the first binding reagent and the first analyte, and(ii) a second binding complex on the second binding domain comprising the second targeting agent, the second targeting agent complement, the second binding reagent and the second analyte, and

(c) measuring the amount of the first and second analytes on the first and second binding domains, respectively.

In one embodiment, if a bridging agent is not used, the method includes (a) combining components (i)-(vii) in one or more steps, (b) forming the first and second binding complexes on the first and second binding domains, respectively, and (c) measuring the amount of the first and second analytes on the first and second binding domains, respectively. For example, the first targeting agent complement and the first binding reagent can be provided as a pre-bound first targeting complex including the first targeting agent complement and the first binding reagent linked through a binding interaction between the linking agent and supplemental linking agent; and likewise, the second targeting agent complement and the second binding reagent can be provided as a pre-bound second targeting complex comprising the second targeting agent complement and the second binding reagent linked through a binding interaction between the linking agent and supplemental linking agent. In this embodiment, the first targeting complex can be provided pre-bound to the first targeting agent immobilized on the first binding domain; and likewise, the second targeting complex can be provided pre-bound to the second targeting agent immobilized on the second binding domain. When the first and second binding reagents are provided in pre-bound targeting complexes, the combining step may further includes combining the first and second targeting complexes with the sample to form a mixture thereof, binding the first analyte to the first binding reagent in the first targeting complex and binding the second analyte to the second binding reagent in the second targeting complex, contacting a mixture of the first and second targeting complexes bound to first and second analytes, respectively, with the first and second binding domains. The binding complexes on the first and second domains are thereby formed by binding the first targeting complex to the first targeting agent on the first binding domain and binding the second targeting complex to the second targeting agent on the second binding domain. Moreover, the combining step can further include combining the first and second targeting complexes with the sample; and binding the first analyte to the first binding reagent in the first targeting complex and binding the second analyte to the second binding reagent in the second targeting complex.

In another alternative embodiment, the combining step (a) includes the steps of combining, in a first volume of liquid, said first targeting agent complement, said first binding reagent and, if used, said bridging reagent and linking said first targeting agent complement and said first binding reagent through their attached linking agents to form a first targeting complex; and combining, in a second volume of liquid, said second targeting agent complement, said second binding reagent and, if used, said bridging reagent and linking said second targeting agent complex complement and said second binding reagent through their attached linking agents to form a second targeting complex. In this embodiment, the combining step (a) can also include the steps of combining said first and second targeting complexes, contacting the combination of said first and second targeting complexes with said first and second binding domains, and binding said first targeting complex to said first targeting agent on said first binding domain and binding said second targeting complex to said second targeting agent on said second binding domain. In this embodiment, the combining step further includes combining the combination of the first and second targeting complexes with the sample and binding the first analyte to the first binding reagent in the first targeting complex and binding the second analyte to the second binding reagent in the second targeting complex. The first and second targeting complexes can be combined with the sample prior to contacting the first and second targeting complexes with the first and second binding domains; the first and second targeting complexes can be combined with the sample after contacting the first and second targeting complexes with the first and second binding domains; or the first and second targeting complexes can be combined with the sample and contacted with the first and second binding domains at the same time.

If a bridging agent is included in the method, then the linking agent and supplemental linking agents each bind to the bridging agent, and the combining step therefore brings those elements attached to the linking agents and supplemental linking agents together. For example, the combining step (a) includes combining, in a first volume of liquid, (xi) the first targeting agent complement, the first binding reagent and the bridging reagent and further includes forming the first targeting complex by linking the first targeting agent complement and the first binding reagent through a bridging complex including the linking agent bound to the bridging agent to which the supplemental linking agent is bound. Combining step (a) also includes combining, in a second volume of liquid, (xii) the second targeting agent complement, the second binding reagent and the bridging reagent and further includes forming the second targeting complex by linking the second targeting agent complement and the second binding reagent through a bridging complex including the linking agent bound to the bridging agent to which the supplemental linking agent is bound. In this embodiment, the combining step (a) can also include combining (xiii) the first and second targeting complexes, and combining the combination of the first and second targeting complexes with the first and second binding domains, and binding the first targeting complex on the first binding domain and binding the second targeting complex on the second binding domain. In this embodiment, the combining step further includes combining (xiv) the first and second targeting complexes with the sample and binding the first analyte to the first binding reagent in the first targeting complex and binding the second analyte to the second binding reagent in the second targeting complex The first and second targeting complexes can be combined with the sample prior to contacting the first and second targeting complexes with the first and second binding domains; the first and second targeting complexes can be combined with the sample after contacting the first and second targeting complexes with the first and second binding domains; or the first and second targeting complexes can be combined with the sample and contacted with the first and second binding domains at the same time.

The methods described herein can be used to multiplex a plurality of analytes of interest in a sample. In this regard, the sample contains one or more additional analytes of interest and for each additional analyte of interest, the combining step (a) further comprises combining, in one or more steps, (ix) an additional targeting agent immobilized on an additional binding domain, an additional targeting agent complement connected to a linking agent, and an additional binding reagent connected to a supplemental linking agent, and (x) an additional binding complex on the additional binding domain comprising the additional targeting agent, the additional targeting agent complement, the additional binding reagent and the additional analyte; the forming step (b) further comprises forming (iii) an additional binding complex on the additional binding domain comprising the additional targeting agent, the additional targeting agent complement, the additional binding reagent and the additional analyte; and the measurement in step (c) further comprises measuring the amount of the additional analyte on the additional binding domain.

In a specific embodiment, the invention includes a method of conducting a binding assay for a plurality of analytes comprising (a) contacting a sample with two or more binding domains linked to at least a first and second binding reagent that each bind a first and second analyte, respectively, of the plurality of analytes to form complexes comprising the first analyte bound to the first binding reagent and the second analyte bound to the second binding reagent, wherein (x) the first binding domain comprises a first binding reagent complex comprising (i) a first targeting agent bound to the first binding domain and to a first targeting agent complement; and (ii) the first binding reagent bound to the first targeting agent complement via a linking complex; and (y) the second binding domain comprises a second binding reagent complex comprising (i) a second targeting agent bound to the second binding domain and to a second targeting agent complement; and (ii) the second binding reagent bound to the second targeting agent complement via a linking complex; (b) contacting the first and second binding reagent complexes with a plurality of detection reagents comprising a first detection reagent that binds the first analyte or a complex comprising the first analyte, and a second detection reagent that binds the second analyte or a complex comprising the second analyte; and (c) measuring the amount of the first and second analytes bound to the two or more binding domains.

A further specific embodiment includes (a) forming a first binding reagent complex comprising a first binding reagent specific for a first analyte in the plurality of analytes and a first targeting agent, wherein the first binding reagent is bound to a linking agent and the first targeting agent is bound to a supplemental linking agent wherein the first binding reagent complex is formed by a reaction between the linking agent and the supplemental linking agent; (b) forming a second binding reagent complex comprising a second binding reagent specific for a second analyte in the plurality of analytes and a second targeting agent, wherein the second binding reagent is bound to a second linking agent and the second targeting agent is bound to a second linking agent complement wherein the second binding reagent complex is formed by a reaction between the second linking agent and the second linking agent complement; (c) mixing the first and second binding reagent complexes and the sample with two or more binding domains each linked to a first targeting agent complement and a second targeting agent complement, respectively, under conditions sufficient to bind the first targeting agent to the first targeting agent complement and the second targeting agent to the second targeting agent complement; (d) adding a plurality of additional binding reagents to the mixture formed in step (c), wherein the plurality of additional binding reagents includes (i) a first detection reagent specific for the first analyte and/or a first binding reagent-first analyte complex; and (ii) a second detection reagent specific for the second analyte and/or a second binding reagent-second analyte complex; and (e) measuring the amount of the first and second analytes bound to the binding domains.

Specific embodiments of the method of the present invention are illustrated inFIGS.3-6.FIGS.1and2illustrate a direct assay method that does not involve a linking complex. These figures are provided for comparative purposes.FIG.1illustrates a direct multiplexed assay for analytes A, B, and C. Binding reagents specific for these analytes, A′, B′, and C′, respectively, are attached to targeting agents, A″, B″, and C″. A solution including these binding reagents attached to their corresponding targeting agents is mixed with a solid phase to which targeting agent complements A′″, B′″, and C′″, respectively are bound to a series of discrete binding domains. The binding reagents are adsorbed to the surface to form binding reagent complexes, ARC, BRC, and CRC, each binding reagent affixed via the targeting agent complements to a discrete binding domain on the surface. The surface is contacted with a sample comprising analytes A, B, and C, as well as detection binding reagents, A*, B*, and C*, which are capable of binding to analytes A, B, and C, respectively, and/or a complex comprising those analytes. The detection binding reagents include a detectable label. Alternatively, the surface is contacted with a sample comprising the plurality of analytes and subsequently contacted with a mixture of detection binding reagents. Once the detection binding reagents are bound to the surface, and optionally, the surface is washed to remove unbound reagents, the presence of each analyte is detected via the detection reagents bound to each discrete binding domain.FIG.2illustrates a specific embodiment ofFIG.1involving the use of antibodies as binding reagents and oligonucleotide-complementary oligonucleotide pairs as targeting agent/targeting agent complement pairs. It will be evident to the skilled artisan that the direct methods illustrated inFIGS.1and2are not configurable by the user. Each individual binding domain includes a predetermined targeting agent complement, such that only a single binding reagent-targeting agent can bind to a single binding domain in the array.

FIGS.3-4illustrate particular embodiments of the instant invention that offer the user optimal flexibility in a user-defined assay configuration.FIG.3illustrates an indirect binding format for analytes A, B, and C, incorporating a series of linking complexes that allow the user to tailor the assay for his/her needs.FIG.3(a)-(b) illustrates a general approach for making the targeting complexes of the invention: a series of solutions are formed that include one of the binding reagents (A′, B′, and C′) bound to a linking agents (LA, LB, and LC, respectively). The solutions also include the corresponding targeting agents, (A″ for A′, B″ for B′, and C″ for C′), bound to a supplemental linking agent (LA′, LB′, and LC′, respectively). The solutions are mixed to form the mixture of binding reagent-linking complex-targeting agent complexes shown in panel (b). An advantage of this approach is that it does not require the linking reagents for each targeting complex to be non-cross reactive and, in fact, allows the linking agents to be used in each targeting complex (i.e., LA=LB=LCand LA′=LB′=LC′). In one embodiment illustrated inFIG.3(c)-(e) the mixture of binding reagent-linking complex-targeting agent complexes are mixed with a surface comprising a plurality of discrete binding domains to which targeting agent complements, A′″, B′″, and C′″ are bound. The binding reagent-linking complex-targeting agent complexes are adsorbed to form binding reagent complexes, ARC, BRC, and CRCas shown in panel (c). An expanded view of the binding reagent complexes is shown inFIG.3(e). The surface is contacted with a sample comprising analytes A, B, and C, as well as detection binding reagents, A*, B*, and C*, which are capable of binding to analytes A, B, and C, respectively, and/or a complex comprising those analytes. The detection binding reagents include a detectable label. Alternatively, the surface is contacted with a sample comprising the plurality of analytes and subsequently contacted with a mixture of detection binding reagents. Once the detection binding reagents are bound to the surface, and optionally, the surface is washed to remove unbound reagents, the presence of each analyte is detected via the detection reagents bound to each discrete binding domain (panel3(d)).FIG.4illustrates a specific embodiment ofFIG.3involving the use of antibodies as binding reagents and oligonucleotide-complementary oligonucleotide pairs as targeting agent/targeting agent complement pairs. As noted forFIG.3, the linking agents for each binding reagent may be the same and the linking agent complements for each targeting agent may be the same.

The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that various permutations of the assay format depicted inFIGS.3-4are possible. Certain preferred embodiments are depicted inFIG.5(a)-(c). For example, all of the reagents, i.e., binding reagents modified by supplemental linking agents, targeting agent complements modified by linking agents, detection reagents and sample, can be mixed together with the surface bearing targeting agent-modified binding domains in a single step to form the complexes shown inFIGS.3(d) and4(d), optionally washed, and analyzed for the presence of analytes A, B, and C, bound to the surface (FIG.5(a)). Alternatively, binding reagents modified by supplemental linking agents, and targeting agents modified by linking agents can be mixed in a single step, added to the surface having targeting agent-modified binding domains in a subsequent step, sample and detection reagents are added, and analyzed in a final step (FIG.5(b)). In yet another embodiment, binding reagents modified by supplemental linking agents, and targeting agent complements modified by linking agents can be mixed, added to the surface bearing targeting agents in discrete binding domains, mixed with sample, and then detection reagents are added (FIG.5(c)). Individual analyte solutions can be added to each binding domain sequentially or simultaneously in a single mixture, and likewise, individual detection reagents can be added to each binding domain sequentially or simultaneously in a single mixture. Any surface binding step can optionally be followed by a washing step to remove any unbound components of the assay before proceeding to the next step.

The skilled artisan in the field of binding assays will readily appreciate the scope of binding agents and companion binding partners that may be used in the present methods. A non-limiting list of such pairs include (in either order) oligonucleotides and complements, receptor/ligand pairs, antibodies/antigens, natural or synthetic receptor/ligand pairs, amines and carbonyl compounds (i.e., binding through the formation of a Schiff's base), hapten/antibody pairs, antigen/antibody pairs, epitope/antibody pairs, mimitope/antibody pairs, aptamer/target molecule pairs, hybridization partners, and intercalater/target molecule pairs.

Biochemistry 12: 1130 (1973)), as well as antibody constructs that have been chemically modified, e.g., by the introduction of a detectable label.

iii) Targeting Agents, Linking Agents & Bridging Agents

Binding reagents are linked to components that enable their attachment to each other and/or to solid phases, directly or indirectly. These components are referred to herein as targeting agents and linking agents. As used herein, targeting agents and their complements are used to adhere a binding reagent to a surface or support, whereas linking agents and supplemental linking agents are used to attach a binding reagent to a targeting agent, directly or indirectly through a bridging agent, if one is used.

In one embodiment, a targeting agent and its complement comprise a first oligonucleotide and a complementary oligonucleotide, a receptor-ligand pair, an antigen-antibody pair, a hapten-antibody pair, an epitope-antibody pair, a mimetope-antibody pair, an aptamer-target molecule pair, hybridization partners, or an intercalator-target molecule pair. The targeting agents and complements used in an assay are selected such that the targeting agents and complements associated with a binding reagent for an analyte (for example, a first analyte) measured by the assay are substantially non-cross-reactive with the targeting agents and complements associated with the binding reagents for the other analytes measured by the assay (for example, a second analyte). Accordingly, in an assay of the invention, the binding of a binding reagent to its associated binding domain (through its associated targeting agent and targeting agent complement) should be substantially greater than its binding to binding domains associated with other analytes (and presenting different targeting agent complements). Preferably the cross-reactivity for the binding of binding reagents for an analyte to binding domains associated with other analytes relative to the binding to the correct binding domain is <1%, more preferably <0.1% and more preferably <0.01%. In a preferred embodiment, the targeting agent/targeting agent complement comprise a pair of oligonucleotides including complementary sequences and the targeting agent and its complement are contacted under conditions sufficient to hybridize the targeting agent to its complement.

The preferred length is approximately 5 to 100 bases, preferably, approximately, 10 to 50 bases, and more preferably approximately 10 to 25 bases. In addition, the targeting oligonucleotides sequences need not be identical in length and in certain embodiments it may be beneficial to provide one targeting oligonucleotide sequence that is longer than its binding partner, e.g., by up to 25 bases, or up to 15 bases, or up to 10 bases. Oligonucleotide sequences and their complements can be generated by techniques known in the art for generating pairs of complementary oligonucleotides with similar binding energies (or melting temperatures) and low inter-pair cross-reactivity (e.g., commercial or public software for selecting probes or primers for multiplexed nucleic acid assays). Oligonucleotide sequences can include naturally occurring nucleic acid bases as well as non-naturally occurring and/or modified bases. For example, the oligonucleotide sequences can include Iso-dC and/or Iso-dG, which are chemical variants of cytosine and guanine, respectively, available from EraGen Biosciences, Inc. (www.eragen.com). Incorporation of such modified bases into oligonucleotide sequences effectively expands the genetic alphabet and permits synthesis of oligonucleotides that have increased specificity and decreased mismatch hybridization potential. For example, an oligonucleotide containing Iso-dC can be designed so that it will hybridize to a complementary oligo containing Iso-dG but will be not hybridize to any naturally occurring nucleic acids sequence. In addition or alternatively, oligonucleotide sequences and their complements can include dimerized and/or dendritic oligonucleotide sequences. Moreover, the oligonucleotide sequences and their complements can be multi-functional, e.g., including (a) a first segment designed to bind to a capture reagent via a first segment complement (i.e., the capture reagent includes a targeting agent complement that is complementary to the first segment of the multi-functional targeting agent), and (b) a second segment designed to bind to an additional moiety present in the assay medium. In this regard, reference is made to copending application serial no. PCT/US15/30925, filed May 15, 2015.

In one approach, a computer algorithm can be used to generate oligonucleotide sequence pairs based on one or more, and preferably all, of the following rules: (i) GC content between about 40-60%, e.g., 40-50%; (ii) a maximum string of base repeats in a sequence of no more than three; (iii) a maximum number of base pair matches of six between sequences in different pairs, with no more than four matches in a row; (iv) a rejection of sequences with predicted hairpin loop sizes between 2-5, oligonucleotides if they have four or more base-pair matches in the stem region (loop sizes of six or greater are retained); and (v) a higher free energy (ΔG°) of the specific interactions resulting from a 40-60% or 40-50% GC content (ΔG° is dependent on temperature and salt concentration, and at 23° C. and 200 mM of a monovalent cation, pH 7.0, ΔG° preferably exceeds −15 kcal/mol). In a particular embodiment, at least relative GC content and ΔG° are considered, along with one or more the rules identified above, in oligonucleotide selection. In one embodiment, it may be advantageous to design oligonucleotide sequences that minimize non-specific binding and this can be achieved by a variety of methods. For example, one can design oligonucleotide/oligonucleotide pairs that form no more than three consecutive G/C pairs with other oligonucleotides used in the assay. Alternatively or additionally, one or more of the following configurations can be avoided: formation of single nucleotide loops or single nucleotide mismatches positioned between G/C-rich sequences when paired with other oligonucleotides used in the assay.

In one embodiment, the targeting agent and the targeting agent complement comprise a pair of oligonucleotides, wherein the pair is selected from one of the following sequence pairs in Table 1(a):

In a specific embodiment, the set comprises set 1 listed in Table 1(c). Alternatively, the set comprises set 2 from Table 1(c); the set can also comprise set 3 from Table 1(c); the set further comprises set 4 from Table 1(c); the set also includes set 5 from Table 1(c); the set includes set 6 from Table 1(c); the set further comprises set 7 from Table 1(c); the set can also include set 8 from Table 1(c); the set includes set 9 from Table 1(c); and/or the set includes set 10 from Table 1(c).

The targeting agent and targeting agent complement may be present in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, the targeting agent may be present in an excess, e.g., in a 2:1 ratio of targeting agent to targeting agent complement, to increase the likelihood of binding the targeting agent to its complement.

In one embodiment, suitable linking agents and supplemental linking agents include chemical moieties that react to form a linking complex. For example, the linking complex is formed by a binding interaction between chemical moieties present on the linking agent and supplemental linking agent, e.g., a thiol group and a maleimide or iodoacetamide groups; an aldehyde and a hydrazide; or an alkyne and an azide.

Alternatively, a linking complex can be formed by a protein-protein binding reaction between a linking agent and a supplemental linking agent. For example, a protein-protein binding reaction can be formed via binding between a receptor/ligand pair, hapten/antibody pair, antigen/antibody pair, epitope/antibody pair, mimitope/antibody pair, aptamer/target molecule pair, hybridization partners, and intercalater/target molecule pair. In one embodiment, the linking agent is biotin and the supplemental linking agent is streptavidin or avidin (or vice versa); or the linking agent is a peptide and the supplemental linking agent is an antipeptide antibody (or vice versa).

Certain embodiments described herein employ linking agents that bind directly to supplemental linking agents. In these and other such embodiments, the linking and supplemental linking agents that bind to each other can be replaced with linking and supplemental linking agents that can concurrently bind to a bridging agent. In these alternate embodiments, a bridging agent is included in the mixture of the linking agent and supplemental linking agent, when forming the targeting complex. Abridging agent, if one is used, binds to the linking agent and the supplemental linking agent. For example, the bridging agent includes a binding site for the linking agent and an additional binding site for the supplemental linking agent, and the combination of the three components, i.e., the bridging agent, the linking agent, and the supplemental linking agent, comprises a bridging complex. In one embodiment, the bridging agent is streptavidin or avidin (each of which are tetramers with four independent binding sites for biotin) and the linking agent and supplemental linking agent are each biotin, such that the bridging complex comprises (biotin-(streptavidin (or avidin))-biotin).

In a preferred embodiment, a linking complex is formed by a binding reaction between a linking agent, LA, and a supplemental linking agent, LA′. A multiplex assay format may be configured to detect analytes A, B, and C, and therefore, the reagent complexes designed to interact with those individual analytes may include linking agents and supplemental linking agents selected from LAand LA′, LBand LB′, and LCand LC′. Each of the linking agent/supplemental linking agent pairs used to construct the binding complexes may be the same or different. In a preferred embodiment, each of the linking agent/supplemental linking agent pairs comprise the same set of reagents. In a particularly preferred embodiment, each of the linking agent/supplemental linking agent pairs comprise, e.g., a biotin molecule as the linking agent on a binding reagent and a streptavidin or avidin molecule on a targeting agent as the supplemental linking agent (or vice versa). In addition, a linking complex can also be formed by a binding reaction between a biotin molecule on a binding reagent and a streptavidin or avidin molecule on a targeting agent, wherein the streptavidin or avidin molecule is bound to the targeting agent via a reaction with a biotin molecule (acting as a bridging agent) on the targeting agent. In a preferred embodiment, once a linking complex is formed between a biotin and streptavidin molecule on a binding reagent and a targeting agent, respectively (or vice versa), excess free biotin molecule can be added to prevent cross-reactivity between additional binding reagents and targeting agents that may be combined in solution.

(iv) Solid Phases

A wide variety of solid phases are suitable for use in the methods of the present invention including conventional solid phases from the art of binding assays. Solid phases may be made from a variety of different materials including polymers (e.g., polystyrene and polypropylene), ceramics, glass, composite materials (e.g., carbon-polymer composites such as carbon-based inks). Suitable solid phases include the surfaces of macroscopic objects such as an interior surface of an assay container (e.g., test tubes, cuvettes, flow cells, cartridges, wells in a multi-well plate, etc.), slides, assay chips (such as those used in gene or protein chip measurements), pins or probes, beads, filtration media, lateral flow media (for example, filtration membranes used in lateral flow test strips), etc.

Suitable solid phases also include particles (including but not limited to colloids or beads) commonly used in other types of particle-based assays e.g., magnetic, polypropylene, and latex particles, materials typically used in solid-phase synthesis e.g., polystyrene and polyacrylamide particles, and materials typically used in chromatographic applications e.g., silica, alumina, polyacrylamide, polystyrene. The materials may also be a fiber such as a carbon fibril. Microparticles may be inanimate or alternatively, may include animate biological entities such as cells, viruses, bacterium and the like. A particle used in the present method may be comprised of any material suitable for attachment to one or more binding reagents, and that may be collected via, e.g., centrifugation, gravity, filtration or magnetic collection. A wide variety of different types of particles that may be attached to binding reagents are sold commercially for use in binding assays. These include non-magnetic particles as well as particles comprising magnetizable materials which allow the particles to be collected with a magnetic field. In one embodiment, the particles are comprised of a conductive and/or semiconductive material, e.g., colloidal gold particles. The microparticles may have a wide variety of sizes and shapes. By way of example and not limitation, microparticles may be between 5 nanometers and 100 micrometers. Preferably microparticles have sizes between 20 nm and 10 micrometers. The particles may be spherical, oblong, rodlike, etc., or they may be irregular in shape.

FIG.6(a)-(c) illustrates various set of particles that can be used in the present invention.FIG.6(a)shows a set of particles, provided in one or more vials, containers, or compartments, that are each modified with a distinct targeting agent. Alternatively, as shown inFIG.6(b), a set of particles can be provided in one or more vials, containers, or compartments, that are each modified with a distinct binding reagent, the binding reagent being attached to the particle in a targeting complex that comprises the binding reagent (through linking a supplemental linking agents) to a targeting agent complement that is bound to a targeting agent on the surface of the particle. Still further,FIG.6(c)shows yet another embodiment in which a mixed set of particles is provided, wherein a subset includes particles that are each modified with a distinct binding reagent (as inFIG.6(b)and a subset includes particles that are each modified with a distinct targeting agent (as inFIG.6(a)). The particles shown inFIG.6(c)include a subset of preconfigured particles with binding reagents for a pre-determined set of analytes and a subset of non-configured particles that can be modified by a user to attach an additional set of binding reagents for an additional set of analytes, i.e., by binding the particles to an additional set of targeting complexes comprising additional binding reagents. These additional reagents may be provided by the user thereby allowing the user to add a set of user-defined assays to a pre-defined set of assays.

The particles used in the present method may be coded to allow for the identification of specific particles or subpopulations of particles in a mixture of particles. The use of such coded particles has been used to enable multiplexing of assays employing particles as solid phase supports for binding assays. In one approach, particles are manufactured to include one or more fluorescent dyes and specific populations of particles are identified based on the intensity and/or relative intensity of fluorescence emissions at one or more wave lengths. This approach has been used in the Luminex xMAP systems (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,720) and the Becton Dickinson Cytometric Bead Array systems. Alternatively, particles may be coded through differences in other physical properties such as size, shape, imbedded optical patterns and the like. As indicated by the cross-hatching of the particles inFIGS.6(a)-(c), one or more particles provided in a mixture or set of particles may be coded to be distinguishable from other particles in the mixture by virtue of particle optical properties, size, shape, imbedded optical patterns and the like.

Alternatively or additionally, the binding reagents can be bound via binding reagent complexes to different discrete binding domains on one or more solid phases, e.g., as in a binding array, such that discrete assay signals are generated on each binding domain and therefore, the different analytes bound to those domains can be measured independently. In one example of such an embodiment, the binding domains are prepared by immobilizing, on one or more surfaces, discrete domains of targeting agents that, through a binding reagent complex built on the individual domains, are configured to bind analytes of interest. Optionally, the surface(s) may define, in part, one or more boundaries of a container (e.g., a flow cell, well, cuvette, etc.) which holds the sample or through which the sample is passed. In a preferred embodiment, individual binding domains are formed on electrodes for use in electrochemical or electrochemiluminescence assays. Multiplexed measurement of analytes on a surface comprising a plurality of binding domains using electrochemiluminescence has been used in the Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC, MULTI-ARRAY® and SECTOR® Imager line or products (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,842,246 and 6,977,722, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties).

FIG.6(d)-(f) illustrate various alternative plate formats including distinct binding domains that can be used in the present invention.FIG.6(d)shows a surface bearing a plurality of binding domains that are each modified with a distinct targeting agent. Alternatively, as shown inFIG.6(e), a surface can be provided bearing a plurality of binding domains that are each modified with a distinct binding reagent, the binding reagent being attached to the binding domain in a targeting complex that comprises the binding reagent (through linking a supplemental linking agents) to a targeting agent complement that is bound to a targeting agent on the binding domain. Still further,FIG.6(f)shows yet another embodiment in which a mixed set of binding domains on a surface is provided, wherein a subset includes binding domains that are each modified with a distinct binding reagent (as inFIG.6e) and a subset includes binding domains that are each modified by a distinct targeting agent (as inFIG.6(d)). The binding domains shown inFIG.6(f)include a subset of preconfigured binding domains with binding reagents for a pre-determined set of analytes and a subset of non-configured binding domains that can be modified by a user to attach an additional set of binding reagents for an additional set of analytes, i.e., by binding these non-configured binding domains to an additional set of targeting complexes comprising additional binding reagents. These additional reagents may be provided by the user, thereby allowing the user to add a set of user-defined assays to a pre-defined set of assays.

Reagents, i.e., targeting agents, can be bound to a surface by known methods, e.g., established methods for modifying particles or for forming arrays. One non-limiting example of a method of attaching a protein or oligonucleotide to a surface is illustrated inFIG.7. This method uses Sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Sulfo-SMCC), a well-established heterobifunctional cross-linking agent. Reaction of the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) group of SMCC with bovine serum albumin (BSA) labels the BSA with thiol-reactive maleimide groups. The maleimide groups are, in turn, reacted with thiol-modified oligonucleotides to form BSA-oligonucleotide conjugates that are linked through stable thioether bonds. Arrays of these reagents can be formed by printing patterns of the reagents on surfaces that adsorb or react with proteins (such as BSA), thereby generating patterned arrays of the associated oligonucleotides. In one specific example, arrays are formed by printing arrays of the BSA-oligonucleotide conjugates on graphitic carbon surfaces, preferably screen printed carbon ink electrodes. Surprisingly, we have found that thiol-modified reagents including thiol-modified oligonucleotides react irreversibly with graphitic carbon surfaces including screen-printed carbon ink electrodes (even when not conjugated to a protein such as BSA). Accordingly, thiol-modified reagents (including thiol modified oligonucleotides and peptides) can be immobilized on carbon surfaces by incubating the carbon surfaces with a solution containing the reagents and allowing the reagent to irreversibly react with the surface. Furthermore, arrays of such thiol-modified reagents (including arrays comprising thiol-modified oligonucleotides and/or peptides) can be formed by printing solutions containing these reagents on carbon surfaces, incubating the patterned solutions on the surface and allowing the reagents to irreversibly react with the surface.

(v) Assay Devices and Supplementary Reagents

The methods of the present invention may be used in a variety of assay devices and/or formats. The assay devices may include, e.g., assay modules, such as assay plates, cartridges, multi-well assay plates, reaction vessels, test tubes, cuvettes, flow cells, assay chips, lateral flow devices, etc., having assay reagents (which may include targeting agents or other binding reagents) added as the assay progresses or pre-loaded in the wells, chambers, or assay regions of the assay module. These devices may employ a variety of assay formats for specific binding assays, e.g., immunoassay or immunochromatographic assays. Illustrative assay devices and formats are described herein below. In certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention may employ assay reagents that are stored in a dry state and the assay devices/kits may further comprise or be supplied with desiccant materials for maintaining the assay reagents in a dry state. The assay devices preloaded with the assay reagents can greatly improve the speed and reduce the complexity of assay measurements while maintaining excellent stability during storage. The dried assay reagents may be any assay reagent that can be dried and then reconstituted prior to use in an assay. These include, but are not limited to, binding reagents useful in binding assays, enzymes, enzyme substrates, indicator dyes and other reactive compounds that may be used to detect an analyte of interest. The assay reagents may also include substances that are not directly involved in the mechanism of detection but play an auxiliary role in an assay including, but not limited to, blocking agents, stabilizing agents, detergents, salts, pH buffers, preservatives, etc. Reagents may be present in free form or supported on solid phases including the surfaces of compartments (e.g., chambers, channels, flow cells, wells, etc.) in the assay modules or the surfaces of colloids, beads, or other particulate supports.

(vi) Measurement Methods

The methods of the invention can be used with a variety of methods for measuring the amount of an analyte and, in particular, measuring the amount of an analyte bound to a solid phase. Techniques that may be used include, but are not limited to, techniques known in the art such as cell culture-based assays, binding assays (including agglutination tests, immunoassays, nucleic acid hybridization assays, etc.), enzymatic assays, colorometric assays, etc. Other suitable techniques will be readily apparent to one of average skill in the art. Some measurement techniques allow for measurements to be made by visual inspection, others may require or benefit from the use of an instrument to conduct the measurement.

Methods for measuring the amount of an analyte include label free techniques, which include but are not limited to i) techniques that measure changes in mass or refractive index at a surface after binding of an analyte to a surface (e.g., surface acoustic wave techniques, surface plasmon resonance sensors, ellipsometric techniques, etc.), ii) mass spectrometric techniques (including techniques like MALDI, SELDI, etc. that can measure analytes on a surface), iii) chromatographic or electrophoretic techniques, iv) fluorescence techniques (which may be based on the inherent fluorescence of an analyte), etc.

Methods for measuring the amount of an analyte also include techniques that measure analytes through the detection of labels which may be attached directly or indirectly (e.g., through the use of labeled binding partners of an analyte) to an analyte. Suitable labels include labels that can be directly visualized (e.g., particles that may be seen visually and labels that generate an measurable signal such as light scattering, optical absorbance, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, electrochemiluminescence, radioactivity, magnetic fields, etc). Labels that may be used also include enzymes or other chemically reactive species that have a chemical activity that leads to a measurable signal such as light scattering, absorbance, fluorescence, etc. The use of enzymes as labels has been well established in in Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays, also called ELISAs, Enzyme ImmunoAssays or EIAs. In the ELISA format, an unknown amount of antigen is affixed to a surface and then a specific antibody is washed over the surface so that it can bind to the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme, and in the final step a substance is added that the enzyme converts to a product that provides a change in a detectable signal. The formation of product may be detectable, e.g., due a difference, relative to the substrate, in a measurable property such as absorbance, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, light scattering, etc. Certain (but not all) measurement methods that may be used with solid phase binding methods according to the invention may benefit from or require a wash step to remove unbound components (e.g., labels) from the solid phase Accordingly, the methods of the invention may comprise such a wash step.

In one embodiment, an analyte(s) of interest in the sample may be measured using electrochemiluminescence-based assay formats, e.g. electrochemiluminescence (ECL) based immunoassays. The high sensitivity, broad dynamic range and selectivity of ECL are important factors for medical diagnostics. Commercially available ECL instruments have demonstrated exceptional performance and they have become widely used for reasons including their excellent sensitivity, dynamic range, precision, and tolerance of complex sample matrices. Species that can be induced to emit ECL (ECL-active species) have been used as ECL labels, e.g., i) organometallic compounds where the metal is from, for example, the noble metals of group VIII, including Ru-containing and Os-containing organometallic compounds such as the tris-bipyridyl-ruthenium (RuBpy) moiety and ii) luminol and related compounds. Species that participate with the ECL label in the ECL process are referred to herein as ECL coreactants. Commonly used coreactants include tertiary amines (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,485), oxalate, and persulfate for ECL from RuBpy and hydrogen peroxide for ECL from luminol (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,240,863). The light generated by ECL labels can be used as a reporter signal in diagnostic procedures (Bard et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,238,808, herein incorporated by reference). For instance, an ECL label can be covalently coupled to a binding agent such as an antibody, nucleic acid probe, receptor or ligand; the participation of the binding reagent in a binding interaction can be monitored by measuring ECL emitted from the ECL label. Alternatively, the ECL signal from an ECL-active compound may be indicative of the chemical environment (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,623 which describes ECL assays that monitor the formation or destruction of ECL coreactants). For more background on ECL, ECL labels, ECL assays and instrumentation for conducting ECL assays see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,093,268; 5,147,806; 5,324,457; 5,591,581; 5,597,910; 5,641,623; 5,643,713; 5,679,519; 5,705,402; 5,846,485; 5,866,434; 5,786,141; 5,731,147; 6,066,448; 6,136,268; 5,776,672; 5,308,754; 5,240,863; 6,207,369; 6,214,552 and 5,589,136 and Published PCT Nos.

The methods of the invention may be applied to singleplex or multiplex formats where multiple assay measurements are performed on a single sample. Multiplex measurements that can be used with the invention include, but are not limited to, multiplex measurements i) that involve the use of multiple sensors; ii) that use discrete assay domains on a surface (e.g., an array) that are distinguishable based on location on the surface; iii) that involve the use of reagents coated on particles that are distinguishable based on a particle property such as size, shape, color, etc.; iv) that produce assay signals that are distinguishable based on optical properties (e.g., absorbance or emission spectrum) or v) that are based on temporal properties of assay signal (e.g., time, frequency or phase of a signal).

(f) measuring the amount of said first and second analytes bound to said binding domains.

In one specific embodiment, a multi-well assay plate can be used to configure an end-user developed assay panel, i.e., an assay panel built by the end-user with his/her binding reagents to conduct an assay with the plate. In this embodiment, the end-user designates which binding reagent is bound to each binding domain. A multi-well assay plate is provided that includes a plurality of discrete binding domains including a first binding domain with a first targeting agent and a second binding domain with a second targeting agent and, optionally, additional binding domains with additional targeting agents. Each of the binding domains are functionalized by the user by selecting individual binding reagents that will be attached to each of the plurality of binding domains via a binding reagent complex, as described herein. In a separate vial, container, or compartment, a set of targeting reagents (each attached to a linking agent) is provided that includes a first targeting agent complement, a second targeting agent complement, and optionally additional targeting agent complements. The first targeting agent and first targeting agent complement and the second targeting agent and second targeting agent complement constitute a first and second pair of targeting agents, respectively. Similarly, any additional targeting agent complements form pairs with the different additional targeting agents on the binding domains. In one preferred embodiment, the targeting agents and targeting agent complements are oligonucleotides (i.e., an oligonucleotide and its complement). In this embodiment, the first and second pairs of targeting agents, and any additional pairs of targeting agents, are selected from the list of sequences provided in Table 1(a) and/or Table 1(b).

Therefore, the user selects which targeting agent/targeting agent complement will be bound to each specific binding domain. The user also selects which binding reagent will be bound to each specific binding domain and forms a binding reagent complex that includes the targeting agent complement of the targeting agent attached to the designated binding domain.

The kit may provide reagents for the users to attach the supplementary linking agent to the users' binding reagents. When biotin is the supplementary linking agent, the kit may include biotin modified with a reactive functional group such as an NHS ester or hydrazide or maleimide. The plate and/or set of targeting reagents can further include a labeling kit for attaching a detectable label to an assay component, such as a detection reagent. For example, if the multi-well assay plate is configured to conduct an electrochemiluminescence reaction, the labeling kit can include a SULFOTAG™ NHS ester, LC-biotin NHS ester, an optional spin column, and optional labeling buffer solution. Further provided can be ECL read buffer and optional assay and antibody diluents.

The set of targeting reagents preferably includes a quantity of targeting reagents that matches the number of binding domains present in the multi-well plate. For example, if the multi-well plate includes ten discrete binding domains, a set of 10 targeting reagents are used with that multi-well plate.

The targeting agents may be provided with a linking agent that directly binds to the supplementary linking agent, e.g., streptavidin or avidin when the supplementary linking agent is biontin. When the linking agent and supplementary linking agent are configured to be linked through a bridging agent (e.g., when both the linking and supplementary linking agents are biotin), the kit may also provide a bridging reagent solution (e.g., a solution of streptavidin or avidin) that can be used to attach the binding reagent to the targeting agent complement. The kit may also provide a reaction buffer that provides the appropriate conditions for the linking/bridging reactions and a reaction stop solution. When one or more of the linking reagents are biotin, the stop solution may include free biotin to block any unused biotin-binding sites in streptavidin or avidin that is present as a linking agent, supplemental linking agent or bridging agent.

In this embodiment, the user supplies the binding reagents, e.g., capture and detection antibodies, and designates which binding reagent will be attached to each of the binding domains. The binding reagent, e.g., capture antibody, is labeled with a selected linking agent, e.g., biotin, and attached to a member of a targeting agent pair via a supplemental linking agent, e.g., streptavidin. Meanwhile, the plate is prepared by binding the targeting agent to the selected binding domain. The modified binding reagent contacts the surface to form a surface-bound binding reagent complex that can be used in a subsequent binding assay for an analyte recognized by the binding reagent. The analyte of interest is detected by contacting the binding domain with a labeled binding reagent and measuring the presence of the label present at that binding domain.

Alternatively, a multi-well assay plate can be configured based on a user's specifications, e.g., from a catalog of available multiplexed assay panels and/or a user can select a set of analytes to configure a user-customized multiplexed assay for that set of analytes. A multiplexed assay panel should be selected and optimized such that individual assays function well together. For example, the sample may require dilution prior to being assayed. Sample dilutions for specific sample matrices of interest are optimized for a given panel to minimize sample matrix effects and to maximize the likelihood that all the analytes in the panel will be within the dynamic range of the assay. In a preferred embodiment, all of the analytes in the panel are analyzed with the same sample dilution in at least one sample type. In another preferred embodiment, all of the analytes in a panel are measured using the same dilution for most sample types.

For a given immunoassay panel, the detection antibody concentration and the number of detectable labels per protein (L/P ratio) for the detection antibody are adjusted to bring the expected levels of all analytes into a quantifiable range at the same sample dilution. If one wants to increase the high end of the quantifiable range for a given analyte, then the UP can be decreased and/or the detection antibody concentration is decreased. On the other hand, if one wants to increase the lower end of the quantifiable range, the UP can be increased, the detection antibody concentration can be increased if it is not at the saturation level, and/or the background signal can be lowered.

Calibration standards for use with an assay panel are selected to provide the appropriate quantifiable range with the recommended sample dilution for the panel. The calibration standards have known concentrations of one of more of the analytes in the panel. Concentrations of the analytes in unknown samples are determined by comparison to these standards. In one embodiment, calibration standards comprise mixtures of the different analytes measured by an assay panel. Preferably, the analyte levels in a combined calibrator are selected such that the assay signals for each analyte are comparable, e.g., within a factor of two, a factor of five or a factor of 10. In another embodiment, calibration standards include mixtures of analytes from multiple different assay panels.

A calibration curve may be fit to the assay signals measured with calibration standards using, e.g., curve fits known in the art such as linear fits, 4-parameter logistic (4-PL) and 5-parameter (5-PL) fits. Using such fits, the concentration of analytes in an unknown sample may be determined by backfitting the measured assay signals to the calculated fits. Measurements with calibration standards may also be used to determine assay characteristics such as the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), dynamic range, and limit of linearity (LOL).

As part of a multiplexed panel development, assays are optimized to reduce calibrator and detection antibody non-specific binding. In sandwich immunoassays, specificity mainly comes from capture antibody binding. Some considerations for evaluating multiplexed panels include: (a) detection antibody non-specific binding to capture antibodies is reduced to lower background of assays in the panel, and this can be achieved by adjusting the concentrations and L/P of the detection antibodies; (b) non-specific binding of detection antibodies to other calibrators in the panel is also undesirable and should be minimized; (c) non-specific binding of other calibrators in the panel and other related analytes should be minimized; if there is calibrator non-specific binding, it can reduce the overall specificity of the assays in the panel and it can also yield unreliable results as there will be calibrator competition to bind the capture antibody.

In one specific embodiment, the kit further includes one or more reagents to insure that the correct steps of the assay protocol were followed. In addition, the variability of the assay steps can be measured independent of the assay. In this embodiment, a series of complementary oligonucleotides diluted in diluents used to run an assay are provided in the kit. As the correct steps are performed, the oligonucleotides in the various diluents bind, extending the chain. The final diluent can include the final complementary oligonucleotide with a reporter or label to provide a detectable indicator of the successful processing of the assay. For example, a first binding domain of a multi-well plate is coated with a BSA-oligonucleotide having sequence A. the assay diluent includes an oligonucleotide sequence complementary to sequence A, A′, and an additional sequence, B. A and B do not interact with one another and specifically interact only with their complements. The final diluent contains a supplemental oligonucleotide comprising the complement of oligonucleotide B, B′, and a detectable label. Therefore, the detectable signal from the first binding domain can be used to verify that the sample was added or the detection moiety was added. The signal generated can also be used to detect if the correct volumes and concentrations of reagents were added, as well as whether there was variability in sample handling procedures and/or equipment. The oligonucleotide chain used in the process can include multiple overlapping sequences.

Different assays in the panel may require different incubation times and sample handling requirements for optimal performance. Therefore, the goal is to select a protocol that's optimized for most assays in the panel. Optimization of the assay protocol includes, but is not limited to, adjusting one or more of the following protocol parameters: timing (incubation time of each step), preparation procedure (calibrators, samples, controls, etc.), and number of wash steps.

In a further specific embodiment, the methods described inFIG.5(c)can be carried out using a kit configured for use in an instrument as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/844,440, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The apparatus described therein enables fully automated random access analysis of samples using array-based multiplexed multi-well plate consumables. The apparatus achieves enhanced sensitivity and high sample throughput. All the biological reagents required for an assay are added by the user and/or provided in the apparatus prior to processing, thereby minimizing the consumable and reagent requirements for the apparatus. Thus, the method illustrated inFIG.5(c)can be carried out in an apparatus as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 12/844,440 by providing the reagents required for the method in a kit that includes a test plate, e.g., as illustrated inFIG.4(a)-(b) of U.S. Ser. No. 12/844,440, or as described herein as a multi-well assay plate, that includes the surface bearing targeting agent-modified binding domains, as well as (i) a set of one or more binding reagents modified by supplemental linking agents, (ii) a set of one or more targeting agent complements modified by linking agents; (iii) a set of detection reagents for the analytes of interest; and optionally (iv) a set of control reagents and/or (v) a set of calibrators. The test plate can be mixed with kit components (i) and (ii), mixed with sample, and then detection reagents are added. Alternatively, components (i) and (ii) can be provided pre-mixed and directly combined with the surface, or components (i) and (ii) can be provided in the kit as separate components that are mixed in solution by the instrument and then combined with the surface as described above. Any surface binding step can optionally be followed by a washing step to remove any unbound components of the assay before proceeding to the next step. In a specific example, components (i) and (ii) are provided pre-mixed and added to the test plate in the instrument. The test plate is incubated, washed, the sample is optionally pre-diluted, and then added to the test plate. The test plate is incubated again, washed, and detection reagents are added. The test plate is incubated once more, washed, read buffer is added, and signal is detected by the instrument indicating the relative presence and/or absence of analyte(s) in the sample. The reagents can be provided in any suitable container in the kit, including test tubes or Eppendorf tubes, or in dedicated sections of an auxiliary plate as described in U.S. Ser. No. 12/844,440.

These and other embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the following non-limited examples.

EXAMPLES

Example 1—Direct Assay Format

The procedure for the preparation and use of a multi-well plate for a direct assay is illustrated inFIG.2. The experimental layout, i.e., which oligonucleotide sequence was located in which binding domain of a multi-well assay plate, was noted. The multi-well assay plate was obtained from Meso Scale Discovery, a division of Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC (Rockville, Md.). A working solution of each individual oligonucleotide sequence complement (550 uL) was prepared by diluting a stock solution of sequence complement about 50 times in Diluent 100 (stock solutions of oligonucleotide sequence complement and Diluent 100 are available from Meso Scale Discovery).

Each capture antibody was labeled with an oligonucleotide having a terminal thiol group using a bifunctional coupling reagent (sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maléimidométhyl)-1-cyclohexane carboxylate (“SMCC”)) and conventional coupling protocols as shown inFIG.5(d), e.g., protein is reacted with the NHS-ester in SMCC to label the protein and the resulting complex is reacted with thiolated oligonucleotides which reacts with the maleimide group in SMCC. A pooled solution (50 uL) of a set of antibody-oligoconjugates was then added to each well of the multi-well plate in hybridization buffer for 1 hour at room temperature to hybridize the complementary oligonucleotide sequences and thereby immobilize the capture antibodies to the multi-well plate to form a plurality of binding reagent complexes.

A solution including a plurality of analytes (25 uL of MSD Diluent 2, with 25 uL calibrator solution of MSD Diluent 2) was added to each well of the prepared plate, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, washed 3×PBS, and a set of labeled detection antibodies (50 uL of MSD Diluent 3) was added to each well of the multi-well plate. The plate was incubated with shaking and the wells were washed with 3×PBS, filled with 150 uL of Read Buffer T (Meso Scale Discovery) and analyzed on a SECTOR® Imager instrument.

This protocol was used to conduct an assay for a 7-plex chemokine panel and the result are shown inFIG.8(a)-(g). The analytes assayed in this experiment were Eotaxin, MIP-1b, TARC, IL-8, MCP-4, IP-10, and MCP-1 (all human analytes). In addition, this protocol was used to conduct an assay for a 10-plex TH1/TH2 panel including IFNg, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNFa (all human analytes). The results for both assays were compared with a standard direct immunoassay absent oligonucleotides linkers.

Example 2—Indirect Assay Format Using an Oligonucleotide-SA Conjugate

The procedure for the preparation and use of a multi-well plate for an indirect assay using oligonucleotide-SA conjugates is illustrated inFIG.9(a)-(c). The experimental layout for the multi-well assay plate was noted as in Example 1. A working solution of each individual oligonucleotide sequence complement bound to streptavidin (SA) (550 uL) was prepared by diluting a stock solution of sequence complement about 50 times in Diluent 100 (stock solutions of oligonucleotide sequence complement and Diluent 100 are available from Meso Scale Discovery). A solution of biotinylated antibody was added to the desired working solution of oligonucleotide sequence complement to prepare a set of individual biotinylated capture antibody/oligonucleotide-SA mixtures. The concentration of biotinylated antibody in the mixture was in the range of about 5-30 ug/mL. The mixture was gently mixed for 30-45 minutes at room temperature. Fifty (50) uL of biotin solution (Meso Scale Discovery) (approximately a three-fold excess of biotin) was added to each individual biotinylated antibody/oligonucleotide complement mixture and this mixture was gently mixed for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. Equal volumes (550 uL) of individual biotinylated antibody/oligonucleotide complements were combined and the total volume of the solution was adjusted to 5500 uL with the addition of a Conjugation Buffer (PBS with 0.1 M EDTA at pH 7.4).

The multi-well plate was allowed to warm to room temperature (approximately 10 minutes). Fifty (50) uL of biotinylated antibodies/oligonucleotide complements was added to each well of the plate. The plate was covered with an adhesive seal and incubated for 1 hour on a plate shaker at room temperature. Each well was washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 3×).

A solution including a plurality of analytes (25 uL of MSD Diluent 2, with 25 uL calibrator solution of MSD Diluent 2) was added to each well of the prepared plate, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, washed 3×PBS, and a set of labeled detection antibodies (50 uL of MSD Diluent 3) was added to each well of the multi-well plate. The plate was incubated with shaking and the wells were washed with 3×PBS, filled with 150 uL of Read Buffer T (Meso Scale Discovery) and analyzed on a SECTOR® Imager instrument.

Example 3—Indirect Assay Format Using Neat SA/Biotinylated Oligonucleotides

The procedure for the preparation and use of a multi-well plate for an indirect assay using biotinylated capture antibodies, neat streptavidin, and biotinylated oligonucleotides is illustrated inFIG.10(a)-(c). The experimental layout for the multi-well assay plate was noted as in Example 1. A working solution of an excess of each individual oligonucleotide sequence complement bound to streptavidin (SA) (550 uL) was prepared by diluting a stock solution of sequence complement about 50 times in Diluent 100 (stock solutions of oligonucleotide sequence complement and Diluent 100 are available from Meso Scale Discovery). A solution of biotinylated antibody was added to the desired working solution of oligonucleotide sequence complement to prepare a set of individual biotinylated capture antibody/oligonucleotide-SA mixtures. The concentration of biotinylated antibody in the mixture was in the range of about 5-30 ug/mL. The mixture was gently mixed for 30-45 minutes at room temperature. Fifty (50) uL of biotin solution (Meso Scale Discovery) (approximately a three-fold excess of biotin) was added to each individual biotinylated antibody/oligonucleotide complement mixture and this mixture was gently mixed for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. Equal volumes (550 uL) of individual biotinylated antibody/oligonucleotide complements were combined and the total volume of the solution was adjusted to 5500 uL with the addition of a Conjugation Buffer (NEED COMPOSITION; available from Meso Scale Discovery).

The multi-well plate was allowed to warm to room temperature (approximately 10 minutes). Fifty (50) uL of biotinylated antibodies/oligonucleotide complements was added to each well of the plate. The plate was covered with an adhesive seal and incubated for 1 hour on a plate shaker at room temperature. Each well was washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 3×).

A solution including a plurality of analytes (25 uL of MSD Diluent 2, with 25 uL calibrator solution of MSD Diluent 2) was added to each well of the prepared plate, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, washed 3×PBS, and a set of labeled detection antibodies (50 uL of MSD Diluent 3) was added to each well of the multi-well plate. The plate was incubated with shaking and the wells were washed with 3×PBS, filled with 150 uL of Read Buffer T (Meso Scale Discovery) and analyzed on a SECTOR® Imager instrument.

Example 4—Comparative Results of Three Assay Formats Using 7-Plex Cytokine B Panel

A 7-plex cytokine B panel (IL-8, hTNF-a, hEotaxin-3, h-Eotaxin, hMCP-1, HIP-10 and hMIP-1a) was tested in the assay formats described in Examples 1, 2, and 3, i.e. direct, indirect with oligonucleotide-SA conjugate and indirect with neat SA/biotinylated oligonucleotides. LOD values for assays were estimated from an 8-point calibration curve assume 2.5 standard deviations. The results are shown inFIG.11(a)-(g). The LOD values for direct and indirect assay formats compare with LOD values observed for standard passive adsorption and immunoassay formats for all tested assays. The indirect approach with neat SA showed significant spread in LOD values: some assays, IL-8 and hIP-10, showed higher LOD values compared to the remaining assay formats, while Eotaxin and MIP-10 showed lower LOD values.

RE49775,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to rocket propulsion systems and specifically to hybrid rocket engines. There are three basic types of chemical rockets in use today: liquid rocket engines that use liquid propellants, solid rocket motors that use solid propellants, and hybrid rocket engines that use a combination of liquid and solid propellants.

In a conventionally designed hybrid rocket engine, the fuel is stored in the solid state, while the oxidizer is stored in either the liquid or gaseous state. Traditionally in most hybrid rocket engine designs, the solid fuel is cast-molded, extruded, or in some instances machined into a cylindrically shaped structure referred to as a fuel grain. The fuel grain is designed and formed to feature one or more internal passages running through its length. These passages are referred to as ports. The fuel grain port or ports dually serve as the hybrid rocket engine's combustion chamber or chambers, and through a gas phase change and ablation process, the fuel source.

The fuel grain is conventionally housed within a metal or fiber-reinforced polymer composite motor case designed to withstand the pressures and elevated temperatures created during the combustion process. The motor case may also feature an internal liner made from a high-temperature material to create a thermal barrier to prevent damage or burn-through during the rocket engine's operation.

The motor case, with fuel grain installed, is attached to a forward cap typically machined or cast from high-temperature metal alloys. The forward cap forms the pre-combustion chamber and houses the oxidizer injectors and ignition system. The aft end of the motor case is attached to an assembly which forms the post combustion chamber and allows secure attachment to the rocket nozzle. The assembled motor case with fuel grain installed, forward cap, and aft assembly with attached nozzle is conventionally referred to as the motor or solid section of the hybrid rocket engine.

In a conventionally designed hybrid rocket engine, liquid or gaseous oxidizer is stored separately in an integrally formed pressure vessel or tank forward of the motor section within the rocket powered vehicle. However, in some designs, liquid or gaseous oxidizer may be stored adjacent to the motor section or even remotely on the vehicle. Conventionally, the tank or pressure vessel stored liquid or gaseous oxidizer is urged through a specially designed plumbing system, typically including a flow control valve to feed oxidizer through one or more oxidizer injectors housed within the motor section forward cap; and in turn, through the fuel grain port or ports.

The motive force needed to urge the liquid or gaseous oxidizer through the oxidizer injector or injectors into the fuel grain port or ports with sufficient flow rate to support combustion may be generated by any one of several means such as enabling a liquid to gas phase change, causing an exothermic reaction using a catalyst, employing a mechanical boost pump, pre-pressurizing the oxidizer tank with an externally supplied inert gas, or using an on-vehicle high pressure tank filled with an inert gas to boost oxidizer tank pressure.

Regardless of the configuration or type of liquid or gaseous oxidizer used, the assembly of oxidizer tank, pressurizing system and associated plumbing is typically referred to as the oxidizer section. Collectively, the motor section and the oxidizer section are referred to as the hybrid rocket engine, sometimes also referred to as the hybrid rocket motor.

Hybrid rocket engines offer certain advantages over both solid rocket motors and liquid rocket engines alike. For example, once ignited, a solid rocket motor cannot be stopped until its propellant is exhausted and it cannot be throttled or restarted. Hybrid rocket engines, like liquid rocket engines, can be designed for on-command thrust termination, throttling, and engine restart. Most liquid monopropellant rocket engines use highly toxic, environmentally damaging propellants that are now considered too dangerous and to environmentally unsafe for continued use.

Compared to most liquid bi-propellant rocket engines, hybrid rocket engines are significantly less mechanically complex, and therefore more reliable and less expensive to develop, manufacture, and operate. Hybrid rockets are ideally suited to use propellants that are self-pressurizing, non-toxic, environmentally benign, operate at ambient temperatures, and require no specialized equipment for handling, transporting, and loading. Furthermore, hybrid rocket engines, due to their propellants being stored in different states of matter, are inherently immune to explosion. Immunity to explosion is of great importance to rocket-powered vehicle designers and operators. Their superior safety, mechanical simplicity compared to liquid bi-propellant rocket engines, and environmental friendliness all translate to improved reliability as well as lower development, manufacturing, and operating costs.

Despite all of their aforementioned advantages, conventionally designed hybrid rocket engines using cast-molded solid fuels like hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), a form of synthetic rubber that has been the most studied hybrid rocket engine fuel to date, are rarely if ever employed for applications requiring vibration free, consistent high performance. Unfortunately, conventionally designed hybrid rocket engines using cast-molded HTPB as well as other cast-molded solid fuels, including paraffin wax, polyamides, and thermoplastics have not been able to demonstrate the vibration free, consistent, high performance required for most rocket propulsion applications.

Excessive vibration and inconsistent performance is even more pronounced when higher energetic additives such as aluminum powder have been blended into solid fuels like HTPB and paraffin wax. All of these disadvantages and inefficiencies are attributable to either the solid fuel material selected or the fuel grain production methods used. To fully understand the efficacy and advantages of the present invention, it is important to understand these disadvantages in relation to competing rocket propulsion systems as well as their respective causes.

Comparative poor hybrid rocket engine performance and their often unpredictable, even sometimes dangerous nature can be attributed to: 1) low regression rate, i.e., the rate at which the solid fuel is consumed compared to solid rocket motors, 2) adverse harmonics build-up inducing unacceptable, sometimes dangerous levels of vibration, 3) excessive solid fuel waste compared to other rocket propulsion systems, 4) low specific impulse (lsp) compared to most liquid bi-propellant rocket engines, and 5) inconsistent, unpredictable thrust performance which renders them unusable in clustered (multiple engines per launch vehicle stage or spacecraft) configurations.

1). Low Regression Rate.

For a given selection of fuels and oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratios, the thrust generated by a rocket or any type of reaction engine is approximately proportional to the mass flow rate. In a hybrid rocket engine, mass flow rate is proportional to fuel grain regression rate. In a classically designed hybrid rocket engine, particularly those using slow burning fuels like HTPB, the burning rate is further limited by the heat transfer from the relatively remote flame to the fuel grain port surface. One of the physical phenomena that limit the burning rate is the blocking effect that is caused by the injection of vaporizing fuel into the high-velocity oxidizer gas stream. Given the linear nature of the oxidizer gas stream, oxidizer/fuel vapor mixing and resulting combustion efficiency is a function of the amount of time available for mixing to occur within a classically designed hybrid rocket fuel grain port.

Attempts to increase the burning rate by mixing energetic materials like Alcoa produced Military Grade 44 aluminum powder (Rockledge, Tex.) (average particle size of 44 microns) with traditional hybrid rocket fuels using cast-molding production methods have been only marginally successful in improving rocket engine performance. Aluminum powder is highly reactive with oxygen and water. To passivate the material to become stable in atmospheric conditions for safe handling, processing, storing, transporting, and use in a rocket engine, the aluminum particle is allowed to form an outer layer of aluminum oxide (alumina), a non-combustible material that when burned acts as a heat sink causing a loss of temperature and energy within the center port.

Nano-scale Aluminum powder is thought to be the next big advancement in both solid and hybrid rocketry. Elemental Aluminum in nano-scale is significantly higher in reactivity than micron-scale powder due to its relatively high specific surface area. Unfortunately, most attempts to safely and efficaciously employ this material in both solid and hybrid rocketry have not been successful. If allowed to form an alumina shell, effectively consuming a portion of the aluminum core, much of the elemental aluminum's energetic value is lost.

In addition to the challenges associated with obtaining a uniform blend of polymer and metal powder throughout the fuel grain using the cast-molding technique, improved burning rates by use of metal additives such as aluminum have only served to exacerbate the problems associated with using relatively elastic materials such as HTPB and paraffin waxes as a primary hybrid rocket solid fuel. Moreover, attempts to improve on regression rate further using high energetic material such as ALEX powder (an ultra-fine aluminum powder produced by the plasma-explosion process) have been even less successful and have introduced a significant potential for spontaneous ignition or explosion stemming from the pyrophoric nature of these ultra-fine powders.

Despite the potential for significant increase in burning rate, on the order of 30% higher than standard Military grade 44 micron particle size aluminum powder, employing a material that will spontaneously ignite upon exposure to the atmosphere or explode on contact with water or water vapor is counter-productive to one of the most significant advantages of a hybrid rocket engine—its comparative higher safety (i.e., benign failure mode and U.S. Government recognized zero TNT equivalency) compared to other forms of chemical rocketry.

More recent efforts have involved the development of methods to stabilize the nano-scale aluminum particles by encapsulating each particle in a polymeric material; thereby, protecting the elemental aluminum from the environment. Some of these approaches, such as emersion in benzene followed by compounding with styrene to form granules of aluminum-styrene, have merit and warrant further investigation. Another developed technique involves a process in which the elemental aluminum particle, measuring 15 nm or less is produced in a reactor simultaneously with the formation of a crystalline polymer outer shell. This passivated material is safe to handle, transport, store, and use as rocket propellant, and the particle core remains 99.9% pure elemental aluminum.

This difference in the combustion scheme of a hybrid rocket engine significantly degrades the propellant burning rate compared to a solid rocket motor propellant in which the solid state oxidizer and fuel are in intimate contact. Consequently, the regression rate, using conventionally molded fuel grain materials like HTPB is typically one-tenth or less than that of most solid rocket propellants.

Structurally soft, HTPB with a Young's Modulus varying between 0.0026 GPa and 0.00756 GPa is a common polymeric binder used in solid rocketry. It has been the fuel of choice for over fifty years in many U.S. Government sponsored hybrid rocket propulsion research projects. Most of this work has involved integrating multi-port configurations into the fuel grain's design to increase the total fuel grain port surface area as a means to improve regression rate. Unfortunately, improvements in regression rate using multiport designs have been offset by reduced fuel volume loading, adverse harmonics built-up that induces excessive and sometimes dangerous levels of vibration, unpredictable thrust performance, and increased fuel waste. However, excessive vibration, unpredictable thrust performance, and increased fuel waste have also been observed in single port large hybrid rocket engine designs using both HTPB as well as faster burning, also structurally soft, paraffin wax with a Young's Modulus of 0.061 GPa. While it is generally understood that regression rate in a hybrid rocket engine is a function of fuel burn rate and port surface area, the increased regression rates achieved using multi-port grain configurations have been more than offset by reduced reliability, consistency, efficiency, and safety.

2) Adverse Harmonics and Excessive Vibration.

In any discussion about vibration in a hybrid rocket engine, it is important to keep in mind that the port within a hybrid rocket fuel grain is the engine's combustion chamber. Combustion chamber wall integrity is an essential design criterion in any reaction engine. Therefore, it is understandable that if a combustion chamber wall's structural integrity is degraded or compromised, chamber performance and reliability would likewise be degraded or compromised. Logically, an engineer would be reluctant to use a compressible, easily fractured material to fabricate a combustion chamber. But, this is exactly the case when soft, compressible, and fracture prone materials like HTPB and paraffin wax are used to construct a hybrid rocket fuel grain and its combustion chamber port or ports. To make matters more complex, given the fuel grain is also the rocket engine's fuel supply, as fuel is consumed, the port wall continually ablates and expands in diameter; thereby, increasing available surface area causing an oxidizer-fuel mixture shift from oxidizer rich to fuel rich combination. Materials such as HTPB and paraffin wax are thought to respond to high pressure gases created within the port by compressing the solid fuel against the higher-strength motor case; thereby, inducing grain fractures and erosive burning—both common occurrences in large scale HTPB and paraffin wax hybrid rocket engines.

Adverse harmonics exhibited in hybrid rocket engines, particularly pronounced in large-scale variants, is thought to be caused by a compressive-relaxation response by these soft fuels reacting to elevated chamber pressures, creating a type of trampoline effect. These oscillations can build to dangerous vibration levels and even a catastrophic over pressurization event. Cast-molded fuel grains made from these materials are also prone to structural flaws such as weak spots, air bubbles, hot spots, and fractures that are also known to cause erosive burning and erratic, unpredictable performance. Fuel fragments breaking free and blocking or temporarily blocking the rocket's nozzle have also been recorded. These phenomena are considered even more problematic in large hybrid rocket engines, especially those using multi-port designs.

3). Excessive Solid Fuel Waste.

A certain amount of residual solid fuel is expected in a hybrid rocket engine. However, in a multi-port configuration, the amount of non-combusted fuel that is expelled can be significant and in certain circumstances a safety concern. In multi-port designs, as the burn progresses and fuel is ablated and combusted, the structure between the ports ultimately losses its integrity until failure occurs. In these situations, chunks of non-combusted fuel and webbing material have been known to break free, partially and sometimes completely blocking the nozzle, which can cause a serious safety problem. In multi-port HTPB fueled hybrid rocket engine designs, the total amount of residual and unspent fuel can reach 15% or more.

4). Poor Specific Impulse.

Expressed in seconds, specific impulse (usually abbreviated lsp) is a measure of the efficiency of rocket and jet engines. By definition, it is the total impulse (or change in momentum) delivered per unit of propellant consumed and is dimensionally equivalent to the generated thrust divided by the propellant flow rate. Typically referenced as performance in vacuum for rockets, lsp is a convenient metric for comparing the efficiency of different rocket engines for launch vehicles and spacecraft.

Generally speaking, there is an inverse relationship between increased regression rate and lsp in a hybrid rocket. Whereas, regression rate speaks to the hybrid rocket engine's volumetric efficiency and thrust output as a function of fuel grain diameter, lsp relates more to the rocket engine's propellant efficiency. Ideally, rocket engine designers attempt to improve both. However, attempts to improve on hybrid rocket lsp has mainly focused on evaluating and testing different propellant combination. Whereas, a classical hybrid rocket engine uses a liquid or gaseous oxidizer and solid fuel, past experiments have been conducted on engine's that use a solid oxidizer and liquid fuels. While many of these achieved very high lsp—in the high 300 seconds (vacuum), they proved to be impractical for reasons mostly associated with the need to maintain a hydrocarbon fuel as a solid at cryogenic temperatures.

Other approaches have involved blending energetic materials such as aluminum powder into the fuel grain composition to increase lsp. However, obtaining a consistent, uniform mixture has always been a challenge using cast-molding techniques, especially when molding multi-port grains. Most conventionally designed hybrid rocket engines using nitrous oxide and polymeric fuel like HTPB average lsp is between 270 seconds to 290 seconds (vacuum), the higher figure attained with the addition of aluminum powder as an additive. While higher than most solid rocket motors, this level of performance is significantly lower than competing liquid bi-propellant systems using liquid oxygen and hydrocarbon fuels like kerosene that average between 310-340 seconds.

5). Inconsistent Thrust Performance.

Inconsistent, unpredictable thrust in a classical hybrid rocket engine is a direct consequence of all of the above listed shortcomings and problems. Inconsistent and unpredictable performance makes it impossible for a hybrid rocket engine to be seriously considered for most rocket propulsion applications and uses. Further, many of the causes of inconsistent thrust performance can be tied to the cast-molding production process used to fabricate hybrid rocket fuel grains. HTPB and paraffin wax fuel grains are typically centrifugally cast-molded, with the latter containing a small percentage of polyethylene to improve tensile strength. During the HTPB polymerizing process, small air bubbles are formed and hot spots are created due to incomplete mixing and uneven curing. HTPB fuel grains require up to 90 days or more to fully cure, and even then, their material characteristics change over time. Small air bubbles are also formed during the cooling cycle when fuel grains are cast from paraffin wax. Bubble formation is a function of the shrinkage occurring within the wax. In an attempt to reduce or eliminate unwanted air bubbles as well as other types of grain flaws and hot spots, centrifugal casting methods, taking up to 120 hours to complete, are routinely employed. Even with these measures, air bubbles, structural cracks, hot spots, and other flaws seem to be chronic for fuel grains made using the cast-molding process.

Therefore, it would be highly desirable to develop a solid fuel propellant and fuel grain architecture-topology that exhibits: 1) flawless composition, 2) a regression rate comparable to solid rocket motors, 3) significantly improved thrust consistency, 4) more thorough oxidizer-fuel mixing, 5) greatly improved specific impulse, and 6) minimal vibration—all without compromising the many safety, mechanical simplicity, and economic advantages inherent in hybrid rocket propulsion systems.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is a high performance, safe to produce, store, transport, and operate hybrid rocket solid fuel grain made from a formulation of thermoplastic solid fuel and nanocomposite aluminum additive; and more particularly, fabricated using a fused deposition type additive manufacturing apparatus.

Additive manufacturing (also referred to as 3D printing or archaically as freeform-fabrication) is the official industry standard term (ASTM F2792) for all applications of the technology. It is defined as the process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies.

An exemplary solid fuel grain suitable for use in a hybrid rocket engine and made in accordance with the present invention has a generally cylindrical shape and defines a center port that runs axially through its length. The solid fuel grain is formed as a fused stack of layers with each layer comprising a plurality of abutting, fused concentric generally circular, disposed beads of material suitable as a hybrid rocket fuel, with each such concentric generally circular shaped bead thus formed, depending upon the additive manufacturing process used, as a ring with a defined cross sectional shape. The plurality of ring-shaped disposed beads is configured in a concentric pattern of increasing radii arrayed around the center port or center opening and made from extruding and disposing a formulation of thermoplastic-nanocomposite aluminum material.

After being loaded into a hybrid rocket engine's solid section, concurrent with ignition actuation to elevate the temperature within the center port above the thermoplastic fuel's ignition or glass transition temperature and the nano-composite aluminum's ignition temperature, a liquid or gaseous oxidizer is introduced into the solid fuel grain through one or more multiple injectors along a pathway defined by the center port causing a thin layer of the center port wall to phase change from solid to gas vapor.

Using a thermoplastic fuel formulation such as 95% by mass Acrynotrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and 5% nano-composite aluminum, phase change will occur from solid to gas vapor along the exposed surface area of the solid fuel grain port wall. The resulting combined fuel vapor and nanocomposite aluminum then mixes with the oxidizer to form a fuel/oxidizer mixture suitable for rocket engine combustion. The resulting combusted reaction mass is expelled at high temperature and pressure through the rocket engine's nozzle (conventional de Laval or aerospike) at a supersonic speed to generate thrust. Generally, fuel formulations with a ratio in a range from about 75% (ABS)/25% (nanocomposite aluminum) up to about 95% (ABS)/5% (nanocomposite aluminum).

Each layer, comprised of a plurality of fused concentric circular beaded structures of different radii, exhibits a geometry that is designed to expose more surface area along the center port wall for combustion than would otherwise be possible if the center port wall were of a smooth, uniform cast-molded design. During hybrid rocket engine operation, starting with the center port wall and working outward, each beaded concentric ring structure, after undergoing phase change and ablation, is replaced by the next abutting beaded concentric ring structure. This process is repeated and persists throughout the rocket engine's operation until either the oxidizer flow is terminated or the solid fuel is exhausted.

Unlike prior art constructions that attempt to increase regression rate using cast-molded multi-port grain architecture featuring smooth port walls at the sacrifice of fuel loading, increased fuel waste, and induced excessive vibration, the additively manufactured solid fuel grain of the present invention supports smooth, consistent rocket engine operation at regression rates previously unobtainable in a single port design. Further, by replacing cast-molding production methods with additive manufacturing methods, grain flaws chronic to both cast-molded fuel grains made from HTPB and paraffin wax are eliminated.

Another exemplary solid fuel grain suitable for use in a hybrid rocket engine and made in accordance with the present invention is formed as described in the above exemplary example, but with each concentric beaded ring structure possessing a pattern that both increases the surface area available for combustion and creates, in its plurality of fused stacked layers, a rifling-type pattern within the port wall. This pattern is designed to induce oxidizer swirling flow around the center port axis rather than laminar or streamline flow; thereby creating a vortex within the center port to enable oxidizer and gaseous fuel to spend more time within the center port thereby more time to mix and combust more thoroughly than would otherwise be possible. This pattern is defined in the inner circumferential surface (i.e., the surface facing toward the interior of the fuel or rocket motor casing) of each beaded ring-like structure. As a beaded ring ablates due to combustion in the combustion chamber, the next beaded ring presents, which also has a pattern in its inner-facing circumferential surface. With this configuration, the pattern is presented in each ring-like structure as each ring is lost or ablates due to combustion in the chamber.

Again, as in the above examples, the pattern thus engineered into the fuel grain topology will persist throughout the rocket engine's operation until either oxidizer flow is terminated or the solid fuel is exhausted. Prior art constructions have employed swirling type oxidizer injectors to induce vortex flow. However, this technique is only partially effective as it cannot generate axial flow throughout the length of the fuel grain and its center port. In another embodiment, rifling patterns have been imprinted onto the molded fuel grain's port wall as a means to induce axial oxidizer-fuel gas flow. Unfortunately, any vortex generated in this manner is only momentary due to the surface pattern being quickly ablated and not repeated.

In contrast, the solid fuel grain of the present invention supports smooth, consistent rocket engine operation at regression rates and at lsp levels previously unobtainable in hybrid rocket engines. Higher energetic combustion, on the order of 50% or higher than hybrid fuel grains using aluminum oxide capped micron particle size aluminum additive, enables rocket engine designers the opportunity to design hybrid rocket engines with significantly reduced propellant loading to meet dimensional restrictions and performance requirements for many rocket powered vehicle applications that heretofore, developers would not consider a hybrid rocket engine.

To achieve such a construction, the solid fuel grain is preferably manufactured using any one of several available fused deposition type additive manufacturing machines capable of fabricating articles in a formulation of thermoplastic fuel and nanocomposite aluminum additive.

The present invention is a solid fuel grain for a hybrid rocket engine and a method for manufacturing same; and more particularly, a solid fuel grain manufactured using a fused deposition type additive manufacturing apparatus.

FIGS.1-3are various views of an exemplary solid fuel grain section10suitable for use in a hybrid rocket engine and made in accordance with the present invention. The fuel grain section10has a generally cylindrical shape and defines a center port16. In this exemplary embodiment, the center port16has a substantially circular cross-section, but the center port16could have other geometries, such as a star, clover leaf, or polygon without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.

More importantly, the solid fuel grain section10is formed as a fusion (bonded) stack of layers with each such layer formed as a series of abutting fused concentric ring-shaped beads of solidified material12arrayed around the center port16. In one embodiment, a heat gun with an ABS stick is used to bond the individual layers. The viscous ABS is applied between the sections before aligning and joining the layers. As is known by those skilled in the art, other adhesives can be used to join the layers.

As is further described below, when incorporated into a hybrid rocket engine, an oxidizer is introduced into the solid fuel grain section10along a pathway defined by the center port16, with combustion occurring along the exposed surface area of the solid fuel grain section10port wall. Accordingly, each concentric ring-shaped structure possesses a geometric pattern14that serves to increase the surface area for combustion compared to a smooth concentric circular structure or smooth walls as consistent with cast-molded constructions. As each such concentric ring-shaped bead undergoes phase change from either solid to gas or solid to entrained liquid droplet, the abutting concentric bead is exposed to the flame sheet. This process continues and persists during the hybrid rocket engine's operation until either oxidizer flow is terminated or the solid fuel is exhausted. Unlike prior art constructions that improve regression rate by increasing the surface area exposed to the flame sheet using a multi-port architecture at the sacrifice of fuel loading, the solid fuel grain of the present invention presents increased surface area as a means to improve regression rate, but without the disadvantages associated with multi-port configurations.

Although the fuel grain section10may be manufactured in various sizes or dimensions, in this exemplary embodiment, the fuel grain section10has an outer diameter, d2, of 19.0 inches. Although a wide range of diameters and fuel grain lengths (or sectional lengths) are possible, the center port16has an initial diameter, d1, of 4.0 inches in this exemplary embodiment (although a larger diameter is shown inFIG.3to enable a better view of the interior of the fuel grain section10). Although many different fuel grain diameters can be achieved with the additive manufacturing process of the present invention, traditionally a ratio of about 5:1 (outer diameter to inner diameter) is used for a hybrid rocket fuel grain.

Each of the stacked fused layers in this exemplary embodiment would have an approximate thickness ranging from 0.005 inches to 0.015 inches depending upon the additive manufacturing machine layer setting or extrusion dye used, as is further described below.

In this exemplary embodiment, each of the stacked layers12is formed by the deposition of viscous polymer which is extruded following a roughly circular tool path forming a plurality of solidified abutting ring-shaped beads of material. Viewed in cross section as depicted inFIG.11, each ring shaped bead of solidified material90is oval or elliptical in cross sectional shape, which flattens on its bottom under its own weight as the material cools and flattens on the top as the weight of the next extruded layer of abutting ring shaped beads of material is deposed above it.

As for the concentric ring-shaped beaded structures thus fabricated, as stated above, the objective is to increase the surface area presented to the flame zone for combustion within the center port16in a manner which is persistent throughout the hybrid rocket engine's operation. In this exemplary embodiment, and as illustrated inFIGS.1-3, the surface pattern presented to the flame zone is characterized by a series of projections and depressions (according to other embodiments the surface pattern comprises a plurality of ribs, a plurality of undulations, a plurality of protrusions and recessions) extending radially into the center port in this case forming elongated undulations that extend axially through the center port. These undulations are present in each concentric circular ring-shaped beaded structure such that as one ring-shaped beaded structure is ablated, the next-presented ring-shaped structure is revealed, presenting the same geometric pattern, but with increased radii.

InFIGS.1-3as well as inFIGS.11-14B, the individual undulations are identifiable and have a substantially cylindrical shape. However, in practice, depending upon the scale and layer thickness, such internal topology can take the form of a dimple pattern14as shown inFIGS.1-3, a corrugation pattern92as shown inFIG.11, a truncated pyramidal pattern110as shown inFIG.12, a truncated pyramidal pattern120as shown inFIG.13, and an irregular pattern131as shown inFIGS.14A and14B, all of which may or may not be perceptible to a viewer's unaided eye. Alternatively, the geometric pattern14,92,110,120,131of each ring-shaped concentric beaded structure may take other forms in order to achieve the objective of increasing the surface area available for combustion that persists throughout the hybrid rocket engine's operation.

There are many manufacturers producing distinct models of fused deposition type additive manufacturing machines in use today capable of processing thermoplastic solid fuel and (with the modifications as described below) a compounded formulation of thermoplastic and nanocomposite aluminum additive to fabricate a hybrid rocket engine fuel grain consistent with the present invention.

For the exemplary examples shown inFIGS.1-3, the fused stacked layers of the solid fuel grain section10may be formed on a fused deposition type additive manufacturing machine with sufficient build scale and capability to produce entire fuel grains or sections which can be joined during post-processing. The fused deposition method of 3D printing machine technology, originally developed by Stratasys, Inc., Eden Prairie, Minn., today is considered a generic form and can be found under other trademarked processes such as Fused Filament Fabrication or Plastic Jet Printing. Examples of manufacturers of fused deposition type machines, of sufficient scale, meeting these criteria include: Cincinnati, Inc. of Harrison, Ohio; Stratasys, Inc., of Eden Prairie, Minn.; Cosine Additive, Inc., Houston, Tex.; and Thurmwood Corp., Dale, Ind.

In addition to fused deposition; there are a number of other additive manufacturing methods that can be employed to produce hybrid rocket fuel grains using a formulation of polymer and nanocomposite aluminum additive without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, including: Stereolithography, Selective Laser Sintering, Powder Bed Printing, and Inkjet Head Printing.

For the examples shown in the various Figures described herein, the fuel grain is fabricated per the flow diagram shown inFIG.15in a formulation of 95% by mass Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), a thermoplastic possessing combustion characteristics desirable for hybrid rocket engine fuel and 5% nanocomposite aluminum. Such fuel having this structure are available from several sources, as known by those skilled in the art.

With a Young's Modulus of 2.0-2.6 GPa, ABS is 460 times less elastic than HTPB and 38 times less elastic than paraffin wax, making it an ideal material for fabricating a hybrid rocket fuel grain and its combustion chamber center port.

Ultra-high energetic nano particle size aluminum, especially aluminum powder produced without an aluminum oxide shell and passivated (by encapsulating or ‘capping’ the particle in a polymer shell) for safe handling and use, will increase fuel grain burning rate by as much as 50% using only a 5% concentration compared to a fuel grain fabricated in ABS with a 25% concentration of standard military grade 44 micron particle size aluminum.

Referring now toFIG.4, in an exemplary method for manufacturing the solid fuel grain section10, the fused deposition additive manufacturing process is performed in an additive manufacturing machine10. The machine10comprises two cartridge mechanisms20and22. One cartridge20stores a spool of ABS thermoplastic, or a compounded formulation of ABS and nanocomposite aluminum additive, that is used for fabricating the solid fuel grain. The second cartridge22stores a spool of water-soluble disposable material that is used to separate the solid fuel grain section10from a support base and support any overhanging structures specified in the design.

However, other types of additive manufacturing technologies that operate differently may be employed without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, the BAAM™, a giant-scale additive manufacturing system produced by Cincinnati, Inc., Harrison, Ohio does not feature a disposable support material. Instead, a solvent sprayer is used to enable easy separation of the fuel grain from its base as well as any overhanging structures that are formed.

Once the additive manufacturing process has commenced, monofilament lines are spooled out from each cartridge20,22and are fed into liquefiers (not shown) housed in a module24, with the liquefiers heating the monofilament lines to their respective melting temperatures. The resulting liquefied ABS thermoplastic and support material is then forced through respective injection nozzles26,28housed in the same module24, so as to form small diameter concentric ring-shaped beads of material that are disposed upon the support base, in this example, a substantially flat plastic sheet30.

In this regard, the module24housing the liquefiers and respective injection nozzles26,28is robotically-controlled to allow for movement along two axes (X, Y) in a plane substantially parallel to the underlying plastic sheet30. The plastic sheet30is mounted to a robotically-controlled elevator platform32that moves along an axis (Z) substantially perpendicular to the module24housing the liquefiers and respective injection nozzles26,28. Thus, the elevator platform32can drop a distance equal to the specified layer thickness after each successive layer has been formed.

Thus, the ABS thermoplastic or compounded ABS-nanocomposite aluminum material is extruded and placed to form each successive layer of concentric fused ring-shaped beaded structures according to the chosen design of the solid fuel grain section10, with each successive layer being extruded and disposed upon the preceding layer. As each ring-shaped beaded structure cools and solidifies, a fusion bond develops between the concentric ring-shaped beaded structure, and as each plurality of such ring-shaped beaded structures forming layers cool and solidify, likewise a fusion bond develops between the layers.

Once the solid fuel grain section10is additively manufactured in this manner, and removed from the fused deposition additive manufacturing machine, any build support materials34can be either physically removed, or depending on the specific system employed, the fuel grain section can also be submersed into a water solution to dissolve any build support material.

The additively manufactured solid fuel grain section10has a substantially uniform fuel grain density and is substantially free of voids. Furthermore, hybrid rocket fuel grains produced in this manner will normally require only minimal post-processing surface treatment. It is important to note that many additive manufacturing systems capable of producing hybrid rocket fuel grains consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention employ different means to additively manufacture solid articles. For example, instead of using line filament, the Cincinnati BAAM uses thermoplastic feedstock in pellet form, similar to those used in injection molding. Stereolithography employs a bath of liquid photo curable polymer and a UV laser to trace the tool path on its surface to cause the material to solidify. Other additive manufacturing systems such as Selective Laser Sintering use a powder bed approach in which a fine layer of polymer powder is laid down to which a hot laser traces the tool path to solidify the material.

Referring now toFIGS.5A-5B, the individual fuel grain sections10a,10b,10c, and10d can be assembled and joined together from multiple separately fabricated sections to form a complete solid fuel grain40. In this exemplary embodiment, each solid fuel grain section10has a height, h1, of 23 inches, such that the overall height, h2, of the complete solid fuel grain40is 92 inches. Furthermore, in this exemplary embodiment, to ensure proper alignment, the topmost solid fuel grain10a has at least one connecting member100a extending from its lower surface and at least one cavity102a defined in its lower surface for receiving a mating connecting member104b. Similarly, the intermediate solid fuel grain sections10b,10c, each have at least one connecting member100b and100c, extending from their respective lower surfaces and one connecting member104b,104c, extending from their respective upper surfaces, and further each have at least one cavity102b,102c defined in their respective lower surfaces and at least one cavity106b,106c defined in their respective upper surfaces. Finally, the lowermost solid fuel grain section10d has at least one connecting member104b extending from its upper surface and at least one cavity106d defined in its upper surface for receiving a mating connecting member100c in the fuel grain section10c.

Accordingly, when heated above its glass transition temperature but below the nanocomposite aluminum's ignition temperature, viscous ABS can be spread or sprayed on the upper and lower surfaces to create a strong fusion bond between the sections10a,10b,10c,10d during assembly. In this way, solid fuel grain sections10a,10b,10c,10d can be readily stacked, aligned, and mated to one another to form the complete solid fuel grain40.

Referring now toFIG.6, after the solid fuel grain sections10a,10b,10c,10d are assembled, the solid fuel grain sections10a,10b,10c,10d collectively define a center port46through the solid fuel grain40. The solid fuel grain40is preferably wrapped in a film50made of phenol or other suitable thermally resistant material. Placed between the inner wall of a fuel motor case (not shown inFIG.6) and the outer surface of the solid fuel grain, the film50acts as an insulation layer to reflect heat and prevent damage to fuel motor cases made from either metal or non-metallic materials such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite. Once wrapped in the film50, the solid fuel grain40can be placed into a motor case of a rocket.

FIG.7is a sectional view of an exemplary hybrid rocket engine70housed within an aeroshell72to form a complete hybrid rocket powered vehicle70incorporating the solid fuel grain40as described above with respect toFIGS.5A,5B, and6. The exemplary hybrid rocket powered vehicle70generally comprises an aeroshell body72, a nozzle82at one distal end of said aeroshell body72, and a payload section74at an opposite distal end of said aeroshell body72. Enclosed within the aeroshell body72of the hybrid rocket powered vehicle70is a hybrid rocket engine including an oxidizer tank76, a valve78, a motor case60, and an oxidizer injector80housed typically within a forward cap (not shown) that also houses the ignition system (not shown). The motor case60houses a pre-combustion chamber (not shown), a post-combustion chamber64, and the solid fuel grain40, which as described above is wrapped in insulating film50.

The solid fuel grain40wrapped in insulating film50can be “cartridge loaded” into the motor case60of the hybrid rocket engine. Alternatively, the exemplary solid fuel grain40wrapped in insulating film50could be wound with a fiber-reinforced polymer composite to form the motor case without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In another exemplary embodiment, the solid fuel grain40can be inserted into a thermal protection cylinder fabricated from insulating material such as phenolic or cork without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In yet another exemplary embodiment, the fuel grain40can be formed to embody either or both the pre-combustion chamber and the post-combustion chamber64without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

FIG.8is an enlarged sectional view of the motor case60of the hybrid rocket powered vehicle70ofFIG.7, showing the flame zone within the fuel grain center port46. As shown, an oxidizer94(either a liquid or a gas) is injected into the motor case60along a pathway defined by the center port46of the solid fuel grain40and flows within the center port46, forming a boundary layer65bordered by the center port46wall. The boundary layer65is usually turbulent throughout a large portion of the length of the center port46. Within the boundary layer65is a turbulent diffusion flame zone66that extends throughout the entire length of the center port46and depending upon the characteristics of the solid fuel selected, either causing a phase change to a gas or entrained liquid droplets of fuel to form. Evaporation from the oxidizer/fuel gas/entrained liquid droplet interface produces a continuous flow of fuel gas that mixes with oxidizer gas at the flame zone66to maintain combustion along the exposed surface area of the center port46wall. At steady state, the regression rate of the melt surface and the gas-gas or gas-entrained liquid droplet interface is the same, and the thickness of the gaseous or entrained liquid layer is constant.

Because the additively manufactured port wall surface pattern14,91exposed to the flame zone66possesses increased surface area compared to cast-molded constructions, the exemplary solid fuel grain40causes increased regression rate and corresponding increased thrust impulse without the decreased fuel volumes associated with multiport designs. Also, unlike the prior art constructions that increase the surface area through a multi-port architecture at the sacrifice of fuel loading, the solid fuel grain40of the present invention allows a smooth burning process whereby, as each concentric ring-shaped beaded structure forming each layer of the fusion stacked layer center port46wall is ablated, a new concentric ring-shaped beaded structure, the plurality of which forms the expanded center port46wall is presented to the flame zone66, as shown inFIGS.9A-9C, illustrating ablation of the center port wall at three different stages. This burning process continues until either oxidizer flow is terminated or the solid fuel grain40material is exhausted.

FIG.15is a schematic drawing depicting the production steps and equipment involved in the additive manufacture of hybrid rocket fuel grains40made from a compounded formulation of ABS thermoplastic and highly-energetic polymer-capped nanocomposite aluminum. Generally, energetic materials are a class of material with high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released. Highly energetic materials include ultrafine aluminum powder, the particle size of which is in nanoscale. As shown in this exemplary example, ABS thermoplastic91is compounded with polymer capped nanocomposite aluminum particles92to a desired mixture ratio. As known by those skilled in the art, generally a nanocomposite is a material comprising two or more constituent solids, the size of which measures 100 nanometers (nm) or less. Even though the nano-scale aluminum particle cores92a are completely encapsulated in a polymer based oligomer coating92b, and thus passivated, there remains the possibility that this highly energetic pyrophoric material can still be reactive with oxygen or water vapor. As a safety precaution, the nanocomposite aluminum, the ABS thermoplastic, and the compounded ABS-nanocomposite materials (i.e., the feedstock to the additive manufacturing apparatus90) are stored in containers designed to store flammable material94, preferably infilled with a non-reactive noble gas at all times prior to their use as feedstock in an additive manufacturing process.

In one application, the compounded feedstock is stored within a climate controlled environment near the additive manufacturing apparatus90.

According to one embodiment of the invention, during the fabrication process a heavier-than-air shielding gas is used to prevent trapping of atmospheric air within the fuel gain during 3D printing. Air trapped in the voids between beaded extrusions and between layers (can range from 5% to 15% depending upon the additive manufacturing apparatus used) is not a problem for fuel grains made from thermoplastic or even when non-pyrophoric micron scale particle size aluminum is added to the formulation. However, atmospheric air (containing approximately 20% oxygen and varying amounts of water vapor, both of which are highly reactive with uncapped nanoscale aluminum particles) entrapped in a fuel grain containing nanocomposite aluminum could present a fire hazard due to the pyrophoric nature of the material should the polymer caps insulating the elemental aluminum core become compromised during production.

Thus, a pure heavier-than-air gas, such as argon, carbon dioxide, or nitrogen dioxide that is non-reactive to nanoscale elemental aluminum particle cores is used to cover the print bed and extruder during 3D printing as an added safety measure, particularly when the shielding gas is kept at a lower temperature to aide in the solidification process.

Given that the gas trapped in the voids will react when combusted within the rocket engine, the shielding gas should ideally contribute to combustion, or at minimum, be inert. For example, carbon dioxide will contribute oxygen to the combustion reaction whereas, argon being an inert noble gas will not.

According to another embodiment, a heavier-than-air inert or non-nanocomposite aluminum reactive gas covers a print bed and an extruder of the additive manufacturing apparatus during fabrication. In yet another embodiment, the printer is configured such that the print bed is fully enclosed and sealed, and an inert non-heavier-than-air gas, such as nitrogen, infills the print bed chamber.

As a further safety measure, each 3D printed fuel grain or fuel grain section is shrink-wrapped to encase the fuel grain or fuel grain sections in a thin plastic film to prevent atmospheric exposure prior to its use in a hybrid rocket engine. In another embodiment the fuel grain is spray coated with a polymeric material or paint that serves to prevent atmospheric exposure. According to another embodiment the fuel grain or grain segment is inserted into an air-tight packaging cylinder and a vacuum drawn to remove all air. The packaging cylinder is sealed before it is removed from the print bed chamber.

In one embodiment a gantry-type fused deposition additive manufacturing system like the Cincinnati BAAM is used to 3D print hybrid rocket fuel grains40on the print bed90a as shown. The ABS/nAl feedstock94is batch-fed into the argon gas filled dryer unit95to remove any remaining water vapor from the feedstock. The now completely dried ABS/nAl feedstock94is manually poured into the argon filled Gaylord box95a within the dryer95, which in turn through piping, pneumatically feeds the material into the additive manufacturing apparatus's extruder90b which is mounted on a moveable gantry90c over the print bed90a. The ABS/nAl feedstock94is pneumatically urged into and through the extruder90b which contains a screw-drive unit which grinds the material, and using the friction heat created, elevates the material's temperature to achieve the desired viscosity.

The viscous ABS/nAl feedstock is then urged into and through a die which deposes a bead of semi-solid material upon either the print bed90a or the proceeding layer of the fuel grain being 3D printed, whichever is the case. As depicted, multiple fuel grains40of two different dimensions are being 3D printed simultaneously on the print bed90a.

Care must be taken to ensure that during compounding as well as during additive manufacturing that the polymer capping material which encapsulates the nanocomposite aluminum is not subjected temperatures elevated above its heat deflection or melting temperature, nor the ignition temperature of the nano-scale aluminum particle core.

The embodiments ofFIGS.12-14Bdepict exemplary constructions of a hybrid rocket fuel grain engineered and additively manufactured to both increase the amount of surface area available for combustion as a means to improve regression rate, to improve specific impulse, to generate an oxidizer vortex flow, and to reduce fuel waste by inducing oxidizer axial flow within the center port46(seeFIG.8) to allow more time for oxidizer and fuel gases (or oxidizer and entrained liquid droplets) to mix and combust more thoroughly. Any surface area pattern or topology that furthers one or more of these objectives, and is sustainable throughout the fuel grain cross-section (i.e., as one fuel grain layer ablates the next fuel grain layer presents a desirable surface area pattern) is considered within the scope of the present invention.

The embodiments ofFIGS.13and14A/14B present a persistent rifling pattern to the oxidizer flowing through the center port46to induce axial flow.

A person of art in the field will recognize that the fused deposition type additive manufacturing apparatuses currently commercially produced and distributed are designed to employ material feedstock in two basic forms: line filament or pellet. Those like the Cincinnati BAAM designed to process feedstock in pellet form are also capable of processing feedstock material in granule form, provided, the granules are of a small enough size to flow like sand under gravity into the machine's extruder.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that additional embodiments are also possible without departing from the teachings of the present invention or the scope of the claims which follow. This detailed description, and particularly the specific details of the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, is given primarily for clarity of understanding, and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom, for modifications will become obvious to those skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure and may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the claimed invention.

FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention relates to a vehicle lamp controller, a vehicle lamp system, and a vehicle lamp control method.

DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

In an auto-leveling control, a position of an optical axis of a vehicle headlamp is automatically adjusted in accordance with an inclination angle of a vehicle in the pitch direction to change the irradiating direction of the headlamp. Generally, in the auto-leveling control, a vehicle height sensor is used as a vehicle inclination detection device, and the optical axis position of the headlamp is adjusted in accordance with the pitch angle of the vehicle detected by the vehicle height sensor. According to other related art, the inclination detection device may include a gravity sensor (see, e.g., JP 2000-085459 A), a three-dimensional gyro sensor for detecting the inclination angle of the vehicle with respect to a horizontal plane (see, e.g., JP 2004-314856 A), an inclinometer for detecting the inclination angle of the vehicle with respect to the gravitational direction of the vehicle (see, e.g., JP 2001-341578 A), or an acceleration sensor for detecting the gravity acceleration of the vehicle (see, e.g., JP 2009-126268 A).

By using an acceleration sensor such as a gravity sensor or a three-dimensional gyro sensor as a vehicle inclination detection device, as compared with a vehicle height sensor, an auto-leveling system can be provided at low cost and in a weight saving manner.

In an auto-leveling control using an acceleration sensor, an inclination angle detected by the acceleration sensor is an inclination angle of a vehicle with respect to a horizontal plane, including an inclination angle of the road surface with respect to the horizontal plane and an inclination angle of the vehicle with respect the road surface. The inclination angle used in the auto-leveling control is the inclination angle of the vehicle with respect the road surface. Therefore, in the auto-leveling control using the acceleration sensor, information on the inclination angle of the vehicle with respect the road surface is extracted from the inclination angle of the road surface with respect to the horizontal plane.

BRIEF SUMMARY

Illustrative aspects of the present invention provide, for an auto-leveling control of a vehicle lamp using an acceleration sensor, a new technology for extracting information on an inclination angle of a vehicle with respect to a road surface from a detection by the acceleration sensor.

According to an illustrative aspect of the present invention, a vehicle lamp controller is provided. The controller includes a receiver configured to receive an acceleration information detected by an acceleration sensor, a control unit configured to derive a vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a vehicle vertical direction acceleration from the acceleration information, and to generate a control signal for instructing an adjustment of an optical axis of a vehicle lamp, based on a variation in a ratio between a temporal change amount of the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a temporal change amount of the vehicle vertical direction acceleration during at least one of an acceleration and a deceleration of a vehicle, and a transmitter configured to transmit the control signal to an optical axis adjusting portion of the vehicle lamp.

According to another illustrative aspect of the present invention, a vehicle lamp system is provided. The vehicle lamp system includes a vehicle lamp having an adjustable optical axis, an acceleration sensor, and the controller described above.

According to yet another illustrative aspect of the present invention, a vehicle lamp control method is provided. The method includes obtaining an acceleration information detected by an acceleration sensor, deriving a vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a vehicle vertical direction acceleration from the acceleration information, calculating a variation in a ratio between a temporal change amount of the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a temporal change amount of the vehicle vertical direction acceleration during at least one of an acceleration and a deceleration of a vehicle, and adjusting an optical axis of a vehicle lamp based on the ratio.

Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the drawings and the claims.

Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. However, the following exemplary embodiments do not limit the scope of the claimed invention. Features of the following exemplary embodiments and combinations of the features described below are not necessarily essential to the present invention.

FIG.1is a schematic vertical sectional view of the internal structure of a vehicle lamp system according to an first exemplary embodiment of the invention. A vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment is a light distribution variable headlamp system including a pair of right and left symmetrically configured headlamps disposed apiece on the right and left of a vehicle in the vehicle width direction. Since the right and left headlamps are substantially the same in structure except that they are arranged symmetrically right and left, description will be given herein below of the structure of the right headlamp210R and thus the description of the left headlamp will be partially omitted. When describing the components of the left headlamp that are the same or similar to those of the right headlamp, for convenience of description, they are given the same reference signs.

The headlamp210R includes a lamp body212having a front opening and a transparent cover214for covering the opening. The lamp body212includes removable cover212a on its rear side, which is removed when, for example, replacing a light source14. The lamp body212and transparent cover214together form a lamp chamber216. In the lamp chamber216, a lamp unit10(an example of a vehicle lamp) is accommodated to irradiate light forward from a vehicle.

The lamp unit10has a lamp bracket218having a pivot mechanism218a serving as the pivot center of the lamp unit10in the vertical and horizontal directions. The lamp bracket218is threadedly engaged with an aiming adjustment screw220rotatably supported on the wall surface of the lamp body212. Therefore, the lamp unit10can be fixed at such a given position within the lamp chamber216as can be determined according to the adjusted state of the aiming adjustment screw22( ) and,220 andwith such position as the reference, the attitude of the lamp unit10can be changed between a forwardly inclined attitude and a backwardly inclined attitude about the pivot mechanism218a. Also, to the lower surface of the lamp unit10, there is fixed the rotation shaft222a of a swivel actuator222used to form a curved road light distribution variable headlamp or the like for illuminating the vehicle advancing direction when the vehicle is moving along the curved road. The swivel actuator222is fixed to a unit bracket224.

To the unit bracket224, there is connected a leveling actuator226disposed outside the lamp body212. The leveling actuator226includes, for example, a motor capable of expanding and contracting a rod226a in the directions M, N shown inFIG.1. When the rod226a is expanded in the direction M, the lamp unit10is swung about the pivot mechanism218a to take the backward inclined attitude. Oppositely, when the rod226a is contracted in the direction N, the lamp unit10is swung about the pivot mechanism218a to take the forward inclined attitude. When the lamp unit10takes the backward inclined attitude, there can be made a leveling adjustment which directs the pitch angle of an optical axis O, that is, the vertical direction angle of the optical axis O upwardly. Also, when the lamp unit10takes the backward inclined attitude, there can be made a leveling adjustment which directs the pitch angle of the optical axis O downwardly.

On the inner wall surface of the lamp chamber216existing downwardly of the lamp unit10, there is provided a irradiation controller228(controller, control unit)for carrying out the on/off control, light distribution pattern formation control, optical axis adjustment and the like of the lamp unit10. In the case ofFIG.1, there is disposed a irradiation controller228R for controlling the headlamp210R. This irradiation controller228R also controls the swivel actuator222, leveling actuator226and the like. The irradiation controller228R may also be disposed outside the headlamp210R.

The lamp unit10may also include an aiming adjustment mechanism. For example, in the connecting portion between the rod226a of the leveling actuator226and unit bracket224, there may be disposed an aiming pivot mechanism (not shown) which serves as the center of oscillation in the aiming adjustment. Also, in the lamp bracket218, there may be disposed two aiming adjustment screws220of the above type spaced from each other in the vehicle width direction. By rotating the two aiming adjustment screws220, the lamp unit10can be swung vertically and horizontally about the aiming pivot mechanism to thereby be able to adjust the optical axis O vertically and horizontally. This aiming adjustment is carried out, for example, in the vehicle shipping time, in the vehicle safety check time, and in the replacement of the headlamp210R. The headlamp210R is adjusted to the attitude that is decided in design and, with this attitude as the reference, the light distribution pattern formation control and the optical axis position adjustment control are carried out.

The lamp unit10includes a shade mechanism18including a rotation shade12, a light source14, a lamp housing17with a reflector16supported on the inner wall thereof, and a projection lens20. The light source14may be, for example, an incandescent lamp, a halogen lamp, a discharge lamp and an LED. In this exemplary embodiment, the light source14is a halogen lamp. The reflector16reflects light emitted from the light source14. The light emitted from the light source14and the light reflected by the reflector16are in part guided through the rotation shade12to the projection lens20. The rotation shade12is a cylindrical member rotatable about a rotation shaft12a, while it includes a cutout portion cut out therefrom in the axial direction and multiple shade plates (not shown). When the cutout portion or shade plates are moved onto the optical axis O, a given light distribution pattern is formed. At least a portion of the reflector16is formed to have an elliptic spherical surface shape, and this elliptic spherical surface is set such that the section shape including the optical axis O of the lamp unit10can provide at least a portion of the elliptic shape. The elliptic spherical surface portion of the reflector16has a first focus substantially in the center of the light source14and a second focus on the rear focal plane of the projection lens20.

The projection lens20is disposed on the optical axis O extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction. The light source14is disposed more backwardly of a rear focal plane which is a focal plane including the rear focus of the projection lens20. The projection lens20is a planoconvex aspherical surface having a convex front surface and a flat rear surface, and projects a light source image formed on the rear focal plane, as a reversed image, on a virtual vertical screen ahead of the vehicle lamp system200. Here, the lamp unit10is not limited to this structure. For example, the lamp unit10may be a reflector type lamp unit that does not have the projection lens20.

FIG.2is a function block diagram of the irradiation controller of the above-structured headlamp and a vehicle controller provided on a vehicle. As described above, since the right headlamp210R and left headlamp210L are basically the same in structure, only the headlamp210R will be described here, while omitting the description of the headlamp210L.

The irradiation controller228R of the headlamp210R includes a receiver228R1, acontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2, a transmitter228R3and a memory228R4. The irradiation controller228R controls a power circuit230according to information obtained from a vehicle controller302carried on a vehicle300, thereby carrying out the turn-on control of the light source14. Also, the irradiation controller228R controls a shade controller232, a swivel controller234and a leveling controller236(aanexample of an optical axis adjusting portion) according to information obtained from the vehicle controller302. Various kinds of information transmitted from the vehicle controller302are received by the receiver228R1, while thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2generates various control signals from this information,as the arises,together with information stored in a memory228R4. These control signals are transmitted by the transmitter228R3to the power circuit230of the lamp unit10, shade controller232, swivel controller234, leveling controller236and the like. The memory228R4may be, for example, a nonvolatile memory.

The shade controller232rotationally controls a motor238connected to the rotation shaft12a of the rotation shade12to thereby move a desired shade plate or the cutout portion onto the optical axis O. The swivel controller234controls the swivel actuator222to adjust the angle of the optical axis O of the lamp unit10with respect to a vehicle width direction (right and left directions). Specifically, when the vehicle makes a turn, for example, when going along a curve, or when turning to the right or left, the controller232directs the optical axis O of the lamp unit10in a direction where the vehicle is going to move from now. The leveling controller236controls the leveling actuator226to adjust the optical axis O of the lamp unit10with respect to the vehicle vertical direction (a pitch angle direction). For example, it adjusts the attitude of the lamp unit10according to the forwardly or backwardly inclined attitude of the vehicle when increasing or decreasing a carrying load or when increasing or decreasing the number of occupants, thereby adjusting the arrival distance of the forward irradiation light to the optimum distance. The vehicle controller302supplies similar information to the headlamp210L as well, while the irradiation controller228L(controller, control unit)provided in the headlamp210L executes similar control to the irradiation controller228R.

Light distribution patterns to be formed by the headlamps210L,210R can be switched according to the operation contents of the light switch304by a driver. In this case, according to the operation of the light switch304, the irradiationcontrollerscontrollers/control units228L and228R control the motor238through the shade controller232to determine the light distribution pattern to be formed by the lamp unit10. Or, the headlamps210L,210R may not be controlled by the operation of the light switch304but may be automatically controlled such that they can detect the state of the vehicle300or vehicle peripheral conditions using various sensors to thereby form the optimum light distribution pattern. This light distribution pattern automatic formation control may be carried out, for example, when the light distribution pattern automatic formation control is instructed by the light switch304.

In order to detect a target object such as a vehicle ahead or an oncoming vehicle, a camera306such as a stereo camera is connected to the vehicle controller302. The image processor308executes a given image process such as a target object recognition process on image frame data pictured by the camera306, and the recognition results are supplied to the vehicle controller302. Also, the vehicle controller302is also capable of obtaining information supplied from a steering sensor310, a vehicle speed sensor312, a navigation system314, an acceleration sensor316and the like respectively carried on the vehicle300. Thus, according to the moving state and attitude of the vehicle300, the irradiationcontrollerscontrollers/control units228L,228R can select the light distribution pattern to be formed and can change the direction of the optical axis O.

Next, description will be given below specifically of the auto-leveling control that is carried out by the above structured vehicle lamp system200.FIGS.3A and3Bare diagrams illustrating the relationship between a direction of a vehicle motion acceleration vector and a vehicle attitude angle.FIG.3Ashows a state where a vehicle attitude angle θv (which will be discussed later) remains unchanged, whereasFIG.3Bshows a state where the vehicle attitude angle θv has changed. InFIGS.3A and3B, a motion acceleration vectoraαand a resultant acceleration vector β (which are generated when the vehicle300advances) are respectively shown by solid line arrows, whereas a motion acceleration vectoraαand a resultant acceleration vector β (which are generated when the vehicle300decelerates or backs) are respectively shown by broken line arrows.FIG.4is a graph of the relationship between the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and vehicle vertical direction acceleration.

For example, when a baggage is carried in the baggage room of the rear portion of the vehicle or when an occupant sits on the rear seat, the vehicle takes the backward inclined attitude; and, when the baggage has been removed or when the occupant has got off the vehicle, the vehicle inclines forward from the backward inclined attitude. The irradiation direction of the lamp unit10also varies according to the change of the attitude of the vehicle300and thus the forward irradiation distance increases or decreases accordingly. The irradiationcontrol unitcontroller228L,228R receive the values detected by the acceleration sensor316through the vehicle controller302, controls the leveling actuator226through the leveling controller236to determine the pitch angle of the optical axis O as an angle corresponding to the vehicle attitude. Thus, by carrying out the auto-leveling control which makes the leveling adjustment of the lamp unit10real time according to the vehicle attitude, even when the vehicle attitude changes according to the state of use of the vehicle300, the arrival distance of the forward irradiation can be adjusted to the optimum.

The acceleration sensor316is, for example, a three-axis acceleration sensor having an X axis, a Y axis and a Z axis which are perpendicular to each other. The acceleration sensor316is mounted on the vehicle300such that the X axis extends along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle300, Y axis extends along the right and left axis of the vehicle300and Z axis extends along the vertical axis of the vehicle300respectively. The acceleration sensor316detects the inclination of the vehicle300with respect to the gravity acceleration vector G and outputs the numerical values of the respective axis components of the gravity acceleration vector G in the three axis directions. That is, the acceleration sensor316can detect, as a vector, the inclination angle of a vehicle with respect to a horizontal plane, i.e. a summed angle θ including a road surface angle θr (a first angle), namely, the inclination angle of a road surface with respect to the horizontal plane and a vehicle attitude angle θv (a second angle), namely, the inclination angle of the vehicle with respect to the road surface. Also, the acceleration sensor316, while the vehicle is moving, detects a resultant acceleration vector β in which the gravity acceleration vector G and a motion acceleration vectoraαgenerated due to the motion of the vehicle300are combined together, and outputs the numerical values of the respective axis components of the resultant acceleration vector β in the three axis directions. Here, the road surface angle θr, vehicle attitude angle θv and summed angle θ are respectively angles in the vertical direction of the X axis, in other words, the pitch direction angles of the vehicle300. Here, in the following description, the component of the acceleration sensor316in the Y axis direction, that is, the rolling direction angle of the vehicle300is not taken into consideration. The acceleration sensor316may also be mounted on the vehicle300in any other orientation. In this case, the numerical values of the respective components of the X axis, Y axis and X axis output from the acceleration sensor316are respectively converted to the components of the longitudinal axis, lateral axis and vertical axis of the vehicle by the irradiation controller228R.

The object of the auto-leveling control is to absorb variations in the forward irradiation distance of the vehicle lamp caused by variations in the vehicle pitch direction inclination angle to thereby keep the forward arrival distance of the irradiation light to the optimum distance. Therefore, the inclination angle of the vehicle necessary for the auto-leveling control is the vehicle attitude angle θv. That is, it is desirable that the optical axis position of the lamp unit10be adjusted when the vehicle attitude angle θv changes, and that the optical axis position of the lamp unit10be maintained when the road surface angle θr changes. In order to realize this, the vehicle attitude angle θv is extracted from the summed angle θ obtained from the acceleration sensor316.

The vehicle300moves parallel to the road surface. Therefore, the motion acceleration vector a provides a vector parallel to the road surface regardless of the vehicle attitude angle θv. Also, shown inFIG.3A, when the vehicle attitude angle θv of the vehicle300is 0°, theoretically, the X axis of the acceleration sensor316(or the longitudinal axis of the vehicle300) is parallel to the road surface and, therefore, the motion acceleration vector α provides a vector parallel to the X axis of the acceleration sensor316. Thus, when the magnitude of the motion acceleration vector α is varied due to the acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle, the locus of the leading end of the resultant acceleration vector β to be detected by the acceleration sensor316provides a straight line parallel to the X axis. On the other hand, as shown inFIG.3B, when the vehicle attitude angle θv of the vehicle300is not 0°, the X axis of the acceleration sensor316is shifted obliquely with respect to the road surface and thus the motion acceleration vector α provides a vector extending obliquely with respect to the X axis of the acceleration sensor316. Therefore, when the magnitude of the motion acceleration vector α is varied due to the acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle, the locus of the leading end of the resultant acceleration vector β provides a straight line inclined with respect to the X axis.

In this case, the irradiation controller228R receives through the receiver228R1the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and the vehicle vertical direction acceleration from the acceleration sensor316. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates a ratio between the temporal change amount of the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and the temporal change amount of the vehicle vertical direction acceleration at least in one of the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle300. For example, the irradiation controller228R, as shown inFIG.4, plots points corresponding to the values detected by the acceleration sensor316over a time during at least one of the acceleration and a deceleration of the vehicle on a coordinate system having a first axis (x axis) representing the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a second axis (z axis) representing the vehicle vertical acceleration. Points tA1, tA2, . . . , tAndenote the values detected by the acceleration sensor316at timings t1, t2, . . . , tnin a state shown inFIG.3A. Points tB1, tB2, . . . , tBndenote the values detected by the acceleration sensor316at timings t1, t2, . . . , tnin a state shown inFIG.3B. The irradiation controller228R calculates the slope of a straight line or a vector obtained from at least two of the points as the ratio described above. In this exemplary embodiment, the irradiation controller228R obtains a linear approximation A, B with respect to the plotted points tA1, tA2, . . . , tAn, tB1, tB2, . . . , tBnusing the method of least squares or the like, and calculates the slope of the linear approximation A, B as the ratio.

When the vehicle attitude angle θv is 0°, a linear approximation A parallel to the x axis is obtained from the values detected by the acceleration sensor316. That is, the slope of the linear approximation A is 0. When the vehicle attitude angle θv is not 0°, a linear approximation B having a slope corresponding to the vehicle attitude angle θv is obtained. Therefore, by measuring a variation in the ratio between the temporal change amounts of the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and the vehicle vertical direction acceleration during the acceleration or the deceleration of the vehicle300, from the values detected by the acceleration sensor316, a variation in the vehicle attitude angle θv can be obtained. By using this information on the variation in the vehicle attitude angle θv, an auto-leveling control can be realized with high accuracy.

The vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment, using the information about the vehicle attitude angle θv that can be obtained by detecting the above ratio variation, carries out the following auto-leveling control. That is, firstly, the vehicle300is set in a basic condition in which the vehicle300is placed on a horizontal plane, for example, in the manufacturing factory of a vehicle manufacturer or in the repair shop of a dealer. The basic condition is also a condition in which only one person is in the vehicle300, sitting on the driver's seat of the vehicle300, or a condition in which the vehicle300is vacant. Through the switch operation of the initialization processing apparatus of the factory or through the communication of a CAN (Controller Area Network) for connecting together the irradiationcontroller228Fcontroller/control unit 228Rand acceleration sensor316through the vehicle controller302, an initialization signal is transmitted to the irradiationcontrollercontroller/control unit228R. The initialization signal transmitted to the irradiationcontrollercontroller/control unit228R is received by the receiver228R1and is then transmitted to thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2,onuponreceiving the initialization signal, uses the values output from the acceleration sensor316and received by the receiver228R1as reference inclination angles,andcarries out an initial aiming adjustment. Also, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2records the values output from the acceleration sensor316as the reference value of the road surface angle θr (θr=0′) and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv (θv=0°) into the memory228R4to thereby store these reference values.

While a vehicle is moving, the vehicle attitude angle θv is rarely varied due to an increase or a decrease in the loading on the vehicle or in the number of occupants in the vehicle. Thus, a variation in the summed angle θ while the vehicle is moving can be regarded as a variation in the road surface angle θr. Accordingly, when the summed angle θ varies while the vehicle is moving, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2prevents the generation of a control signal for instructing the optical axis adjustment. Alternatively, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2may generate a control signal for instruction to maintain of the optical axis position in response to a variation in the summed angle θ while the vehicle is moving, and the transmitter228R3may transmit it to the leveling controller236. Whether the vehicle300is moving or not can be determined by, for example, a vehicle speed obtained from the vehicle speed sensor312. “While the vehicle is moving” can be defined as, for example, from the time when the vehicle speed obtained from the vehicle speed sensor312exceeds 0 to the time when the vehicle speed obtained from the vehicle speed sensor312becomes 0. “While the vehicle is moving” can optionally be defined based on an experiment or simulation by a designer.

When the vehicle is stopped, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2subtracts the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv read out from the memory228R4from the current summed angle θ detected by the acceleration sensor316to calculate the road surface angle θr. The road surface angle θr is recorded into the memory228R4as the new reference value of the road surface angle θr. “When the vehicle is stopped” is, for example, the time when the value detected by the acceleration sensor316becomes stable after the vehicle speed obtained by the vehicle speed sensor312became 0. The reason why it is the time when the value detected by the acceleration sensor316becomes stable is that it takes a little time for the attitude of the vehicle300to become stable after the vehicle300stops and thus, in a state where the vehicle attitude is not stable, it is difficult to detect the accurate summed angle θ. The “the time when the value becomes stable” may be defined as the time when the variations in the values detected by the acceleration sensor316per unit time becomes equal to or less than a threshold, or as the time when a given period of time has elapsed after the vehicle speed detected by the vehicle speed sensor312became 0. The time “when the vehicle is stopped”, the “threshold” and the “given period of time” can optionally be set based on an experiment or simulation by a designer.

While the vehicle is stopped, it is rare that the vehicle300moves and the road surface angle θr changes. Thus, a variation in the summed angle θ while the vehicle is stopped can be regarded as a variation in the vehicle attitude angle θv. Thus, when the summed angle θ varies while the vehicle is stopped, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2, using the vehicle attitude angle θv obtained from the values detected by the acceleration sensor316and the reference value of the road surface angle θr read out from the memory228R4, generates a control signal for instructing the optical axis adjustment. More specifically, while the vehicle is stopped, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates the vehicle attitude angle θv repetitively at given timings. The vehicle attitude angle θv can be obtained by subtracting the road surface angle θr stored in the memory228R4from the current summed angle θ received from the acceleration sensor316. When the difference between the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4is equal to or more than a threshold, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2generates a control signal according to the newly obtained vehicle attitude angle θv. This can avoid frequent optical axis adjustments and, as a result, the control burden of thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2can be reduced and the life of the leveling actuator226can be extended. The thus generated control signal is transmitted to the leveling controller236by the transmitter228R3, whereby an optical axis adjustment according to the control signal can be carried out. The calculated vehicle attitude angle θv is recorded into the memory228R4as a new reference value.

“While the vehicle is stopped” means, for example, a period from the time when the value detected by the acceleration sensor316becomes stable to the time when the vehicle starts moving. The “time when the vehicle starts moving” means, for example, the time when the vehicle speed detected by theaccelerationvehicle speedsensor312exceeds 0. “While the vehicle is stopped” can optionally be defined based on an experiment or simulation by a designer.

During at least one of the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle, for example, for a given time when the vehicle starts or stops, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2records the values output from the acceleration sensor316. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2plots the recorded output values on a coordinate system having a first axis representing the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a second axis representing the vehicle vertical direction acceleration, and using the method of least square, calculates linear approximations continuously or at every given time. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2generates a control signal for instructing the optical axis adjustment of the lamp unit10according to a variation in the slope of the obtained linear approximations, thereby correcting the optical axis position. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2also corrects the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4. For example, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2compares the currently obtained slope of the linear approximation with the previously obtained slope of the linear approximation and, when there is a variation in the slope of the linear approximation, carries out a correction process according to this slope variation.

For example, where the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4is p°andthe accumulated value of variations in the slope of the linear approximation from the first calculation is q°, or where the variation amount of the vehicle attitude angle θv while the vehicle is stopped,(that is, a difference between the vehicle attitude angle θv stored when the vehicle is stopped and the vehicle attitude angle θv stored when the vehicle starts moving)is p°, and a slope difference between a linear approximation calculated when the vehicle previously started moving and a linear approximation calculated when the vehicle starts moving is q°, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2generates a control signal for adjusting the optical axis position only by an error (p−q)° of the vehicle attitude angle θv, and the transmitter228R3transmits this control signal. Also, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2corrects the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4only by (p−q)°. Thus, as described above, by rewriting the reference values of the road surface angle θr and vehicle attitude angle θv repetitively, there can be prevented a possibility that the detection errors or the like of the acceleration sensor316can be accumulated to thereby deteriorate the accuracy of the auto-leveling control. Or, the accuracy deterioration of the auto-leveling control can be reduced.

The method for correcting the optical axis position and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv may also be as follows. That is, when there cannot be avoided disturbances such as the inclination of the vehicle attitude due to the acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle300and the inclination of the vehicle attitude due to the turning of the vehicle300, there is a possibility that the amount of variations in the slope of the linear approximation can deviate greatly from the amount of variations in the vehicle attitude angle θv. In this case, even when the optical axis position and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv are corrected by the variation amount of the slope of the linear approximation, they deviate from the actual vehicle attitude angle θv. Also, since the varied slope of the linear approximation raises a high possibility that the actual vehicle attitude angle θv deviates from the reference value stored, there is a possibility that, even when the optical axis is adjusted using the reference value stored, the auto-leveling control cannot be carried out with high accuracy. Therefore, when a variation in the above-mentioned ratio or in the slope of the linear approximation is detected, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2, as the correction control of the optical axis position according to this slope variation, moves the optical axis position nearer to the horizontal direction or to the initial position to thereby draw the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv nearer to 0°. Due to this, even when the optical axis position of the lamp unit10cannot be made to follow a variation in the vehicle attitude angle θv with high accuracy, there can be realized a failsafe function which moves the optical axis position nearer to the horizontal direction or to the initial position to thereby secure the visibility of a driver.

Here, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2may also be structured such that, when a difference between the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4is equal to or more than a threshold, it stores the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv into the memory228R4as a new reference value. Similarly, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2may also be structured such that, when a difference between the calculated road surface angle θr and the reference value of the road surface angle θr stored in the memory228R4is equal to or more than a threshold, it stores the calculated road surface angle θr into the memory228R4as a new reference value. This can prevent the reference value of the road surface angle θr or vehicle attitude angle θv from being rewritten frequently. Also, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2may also calculate the road surface angle θr when the summed angles θ in the start and stop times of the vehicle300differ from each other. This can reduce the control burden of thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2.

Also, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2may also previously store the values detected by the acceleration sensor316in the acceleration and deceleration times of the vehicle300from one-time start to stop thereof and, in the vehicle stop time or the like, may calculate a linear approximation to thereby perform the above-mentioned correction process.

FIG.5is a flow chart of the auto-leveling control of the vehicle lamp system according to the first exemplary embodiment. In the flow chart ofFIG.5, the processing procedures of the respective parts are designated using combinations of S (STEP) and numerals. Also, in a process designated by a combination of S and a numeral, there is carried out some check process. When the check result thereof is positive, Y (YES) is added to designate, for example, (S101; Y) and, oppositely, when the check result is negative, N (NO) is added to designate, for example, (S101; N). For example, in a state where an instruction for execution of an auto-leveling control mode is given by the light switch304, when the ignition is turned on, this flow is carried out repetitively at a given timing by the irradiation controller228R (controlcontroller/controlunit228R2) and, when the ignition is turned off, it is ended.

Firstly, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whether a vehicle is moving (S101). If it is determined that the vehicle is moving (S101; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whether the vehicle is in an accelerating or decelerating mode or not (S102). The acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle can be detected, for example, from the value detected by the acceleration sensor316, or from whether an accelerator pedal or a brake pedal (neither of them are shown) is pressed down. If it is determined that the vehicle is in the accelerating or decelerating mode (S102; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates a linear approximation from the multiple values output from the acceleration sensor316and compares the slope of the currently calculated linear approximation with the slope of the previously calculated linear approximation (S103). Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whether there is a variation in the slope of the linear approximation (S104). If it is determined that there is a variation in the slope of the linear approximation (S104; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2generates a control signal for instructing the optical axis adjustment to thereby correct the optical axis position and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv (S105). After that, even when a summed angle θ detected by the acceleration sensor316has varied, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2does not generate a control signal for instructing the optical axis adjustment but avoids the optical axis adjustment, ending this routine. If it is determined that the vehicle is not in an accelerating or decelerating mode (S102; N)andorthat there is no variation in the slope of the linear approximation (S104; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit22882228R2also avoids the optical axis adjustment (S106) and ends this routine.

If it is determined that the vehicle is not moving (S101; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whetherit is whenthe vehicle is stopped (S107). If it is determined thatit is whenthe vehicle is stopped (S107; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2subtracts the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv from the current summed angle θ to calculate the road surface angle θr (S108) and stores the calculated road surface angle θr into the memory228R4as a new reference value (S109). Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2then avoids the optical axis adjustment (S106) and ends this routine.

If it is determined thatit is not whenthe vehicle isnotstopped (S107; N),because the vehicle is actually not moving,andthecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2subtracts the reference value of the road surface angle θr from the current summed angle θ to calculate the vehicle attitude angle θv (S110). Next, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whether a difference between the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv is equal to or more than a threshold (S111). If it is determined that the difference is less than the threshold (S111; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2avoids the optical axis adjustment (S106) and ends this routine. If it is determined that the difference is equal to or more than the threshold (S111; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2adjusts the optical axis position according to the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv (S112). Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2then stores the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv into the memory228R4as a reference value (S113) and ends this routine.

Here, in the left headlamp210L, the irradiation controller228L, more specifically, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228L2, carries out similar control. Alternatively, one of the irradiationportionscontrollers/control units228L and228R may calculate the vehicle attitude angle θv and road surface angle θr, while the other may obtain the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv and road surface angle θr to adjust the optical axis O.

While the vehicle is moving, generally, the period during which the vehicle300maintains its speed constant is short. Thus, it can be presumed that, most of the time during its movement, the vehicle is accelerating or decelerating. Therefore, it is possible to omit Step S102for checking whether the vehicle300is accelerating or decelerating.

As described above, the vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment receives an acceleration information from the acceleration sensor316in such a form that a vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a vehicle vertical direction acceleration aredrivablederivablefrom the acceleration information, and adjusts the optical axis of the lamp unit10based on a variation in the ratio between the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle longitudinal direction and the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle vertical direction during at least one of the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle300. Thus, the vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment obtains information about the vehicle attitude angle θv using a new extraction method which obtains a variation in the vehicle attitude angle θv from a variation in the ratio between the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle longitudinal direction and the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle vertical direction during the acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle. That is, the vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment obtains information about the vehicle attitude angle θv from the plot characteristic of the acceleration sensor316. Therefore, with use of the vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment, there can be provided a new technology which extracts information about the vehicle attitude angle θv from the summed angle θ detected by the acceleration sensor316.

Further, according to the vehicle lamp system200described above,whenthe summed angle θ varies while the vehicle is moving, adue to a road surface situation. Aroad surface angle θr is derived from the varied summed angle θat a time when the vehicle is stoppedand the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θvandthe stored reference value of the road surface angle θr is rewritten, and when the summed angle θ varies while the vehicle is stopped, a vehicle attitude angle θv is derived from the varied summed angle θ and the reference value of the road surface angle θr and the stored reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv is rewritten. During the acceleration or the deceleration of the vehicle300, and using information about the vehicle attitude angle θv extracted by the above method, the vehicle lamp system200corrects the optical axis position of the lamp unit10and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory 228R4. Therefore, the vehicle lamp system200can carry out auto-leveling control using an acceleration sensor with high accuracy.

A vehicle lamp system200according to a second exemplary embodiment is a system which derives a vehicle attitude angle θv from a ratio between the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle longitudinal direction and the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle vertical direction and, using the derived vehicle attitude angle θv, carries out an optical axis adjustment. Now, description will be given below of this exemplary embodiment. The components of this vehicle lamp system200according to the second exemplary embodiment, that are similar to those of the first exemplary embodiment, are given the same reference signs, and the description thereof will be omitted.

The vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment, using information about the vehicle attitude angle θv to be obtained by detecting the above-mentioned variation in the ratio, carries out the following auto-leveling control. That is, firstly, the vehicle300set in a basic condition in which the vehicle300moves on a horizontal plane, for example, in the manufacturing factory of a vehicle manufacturer or in the repair shop of a dealer. In this basic condition, the vehicle300is accelerated or decelerated. As an initialization process, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2receives acceleration information from the acceleration sensor316and calculates a ratio between the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle longitudinal direction and the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle vertical direction during at least one of the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle300. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2stores the calculated ratio into the memory228R4as a reference value of the ratio.

When the vehicle300is actually in use, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates a ratio between the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle longitudinal direction and the temporal change amount of the acceleration in the vehicle vertical direction during at least one of the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle300. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2obtains a vehicle attitude angle θv from the reference value of the ratio previously stored in the initialization process and the current ratio, and carries out an optical axis adjustment using the obtained vehicle attitude angle θv.

For example, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2, in the initialization process, plots points corresponding to the values detected by the acceleration sensor316on a coordinate system having a first axis representing the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a second axis representing the vehicle vertical direction acceleration, obtains a reference linear approximation from the plotted points, and calculates the slope of this reference linear approximation as the reference value of the ratio. When the vehicle is in actual use, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2records, for example, for a given period of time when the vehicleisstarting to move orisstoppingto movemovement, the values output from the acceleration sensor316, plots the recorded output values on the coordinate system to find a linear approximation and calculates the slope of the linear approximation as the ratio. Here, an angle (θABinFIG.4) formed between the reference linear approximation and the linear approximation calculated under the vehicle actual use state corresponds to the vehicle attitude angle θv. Therefore, by comparing the slopes of the two linear approximations or the above-mentioned ratios, the vehicle attitude angle θv can be obtained.

As described above, the vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment obtains the vehicle attitude angle θv from the reference value of the ratio, that is obtained while the vehicle300is on the horizontal plane, and the current ratio to thereby make the optical axis adjustment. According totheanauto-leveling control system configured such that the reference value of the road surface angle θr is rewritten when the summed angle θ varies while the vehicle is moving, and such that the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv is rewritten when the summed angle θ varies while the vehicle is stopped, the repetitive rewriting of the reference values can increase the error of the adjustment. On the other hand, in the auto-leveling control according to this exemplary embodiment, the optical axis position can be adjusted without increasing such adjustment error.

A vehicle lamp system200according to an third exemplary embodiment calculates a linear approximation using a set of values output from the sensor during the acceleration of the vehicle and values output from the sensor during the deceleration of the vehicle. Now, description will be given below of this exemplary embodiment. The components of the vehicle lamp system200according to the third exemplary embodiment, that are similar to those of the first exemplary embodiment, are given the same reference sings, and the description thereof will be omitted.

FIG.6is a diagram to explain the auto-leveling control of the vehicle lamp system of the third exemplary embodiment. As shown inFIG.6, in the vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2stores a first acceleration range P1(+) and a second acceleration range P2(+) of the acceleration of the vehicle300as well as a first deceleration range P1(−) and a second deceleration range P2(−) of the deceleration (negative acceleration) of the vehicle300as information onaanacceleration range in which plotting is carried out to calculate a linear approximation (this information is hereinafter referred to as plot range information). This plot range information has a set of an acceleration side range and a deceleration side range. In this exemplary embodiment, the plot range information has two sets, one set including the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−), and the other set including the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−). The acceleration range and deceleration range can be set based on the amount of time variations in the vehicle speeds to be detected by the vehicle speed sensor312or the magnitude of the vehicle longitudinal direction components that can be obtained from the values detected by the acceleration sensor316. The plot range information is stored in, for example, the memory228R4.

For example, during the time from the start of the vehicle300to the stop thereof, when the acceleration of the vehicle300is within the first acceleration range P1(+) or within the second acceleration range P2(+), or when the deceleration is within the first deceleration range P1(−) or within the second deceleration range P2(−), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2records the values detected by the acceleration sensor316. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2plots points corresponding to the recorded detection values on a coordinate system having a first axis representing the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and a second axis representing the vehicle vertical direction, thereby calculating a linear approximation. Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates the linear approximation, for example, at the time when, while the vehicle300is moving, the values detected by the acceleration sensor316or the plotted values thereof in the first acceleration range P1(+), first deceleration range P1(−), the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−) are arranged.

Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2corrects the optical axis O and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv based a variation in the slope of the calculated linear approximation at a given timing while the vehicle is moving. More specifically, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates an error component Δθe, which is a difference between the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv and a vehicle attitude angle θv obtained from the slope of the linear approximation (a ratio between the temporal change amount of acceleration in the vehicle longitudinal direction and the temporal change amount of acceleration in the vehicle vertical direction). For example, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates the accumulated value of variations in the slope of the linear approximation from the first time to the current time calculations to derive the vehicle attitude angle θv, and finds the error component Δθe from this vehicle attitude angle θv and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4. Or, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2, similarly to the second exemplary embodiment, may obtain a vehicle attitude angle θv from the slopes of the previously stored reference linear approximation and the calculated linear approximation, and may find an error component Δθe from this vehicle attitude angle θv and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4.

Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2corrects the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv such that the error component Δθe is reduced. In this case, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2, when the absolute value of the obtained the error component Δθe exceeds a threshold value θth (|Δθe|>θth), corrects the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv by a correction value θc. Also, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2generates a control signal for adjusting the optical axis position by the correction value θc, thereby correcting the optical axis position. Here, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2may also carry out the above-mentioned correction process, for example, just after the stop of the vehicle300.

The “threshold value θth” and the “correction value θc” can be set in accordance with the resolution of the optical axis control, the detection accuracy of the error component Δθe, or the detection resolution of the vehicle attitude angle θv using a variation in the slope of the linear approximation. The threshold value θth is set within the range of the error that provides no obstacle to the optical axis control. The correction value θc is set, for example, based on the error that is caused by, of error main factors, an error factor having the smallest generation error value. Such error factor includes, for example, variations in the vehicle attitude under the same load condition, that is, variations in the suspension of the vehicle.

The correction value θc is smaller than the threshold value θth. Due to this, even when the detection accuracy of the error component Δθe is low, the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv can be made to approximate gradually to a correct value. For example, the resolution of the angle detection using variations in the slope of the linear approximation is 0.04°, while the threshold value θth is set for 0.1° and the correction value θc is set for 0.03° respectively. The “threshold value θth” and “correction value θc” can be set based on an experiment or simulation by a designer.

As described above, the plot range information has a set of the acceleration side range and deceleration side range. Due to such combination of the acceleration side range and deceleration side range, the error component of the vehicle attitude variations to be caused by acceleration and the error component of the vehicle attitude variations caused by deceleration can cancel each other. This makes it possible to calculate a linear approximation with higher accuracy. Also, the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) as well as the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−) are set respectively such that the ranges of the magnitude (absolute values) of the acceleration and deceleration are equal to each other. Due to such setting, the error component of the vehicle attitude variations to be caused by acceleration and the error component of the vehicle attitude variations caused by deceleration can cancel each other. This makes it possible to calculate a linear approximation with further higher accuracy.

In this exemplary embodiment, the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) are set such that they respectively provide a range of given gentle acceleration or deceleration. Also, the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−) are set respectively such that they respectively provide a range of given rapid acceleration or deceleration which is larger when compared with the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−). In this exemplary embodiment, since the plot range information has a set of gentle and rapid acceleration and deceleration ranges, when compared with a case employing only a set of gentle acceleration and deceleration or only a set of rapid acceleration and deceleration, a linear approximation can be calculated with higher accuracy.

Here, for the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) as well as the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−), there may also be calculated linear approximations independently of each other and the respective correction processes may be carried out according to the slopes of the respective linear approximations. In this case, according to the calculation frequency or calculation accuracy of the set of the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) as well as the set of the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−), the weight of correction may be different from each other, for example, the magnitude of the correction value θc may be varied. Or, the correction process may be carried out according to the average of the slopes of the linear approximations calculated respectively independently. Further, when, in the set of the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) as well as the set of the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−), plots are arranged, a linear approximation may be calculated using these plots; and, when the plots are not ready in both sets within a given time, a linear approximation may be calculated using the plots of the set in which the plots are ready at the that time.

The plot range information may have only the set of the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) or only the set of the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−). For example, the set of the first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) set in the gentle acceleration and deceleration range, when compared with the set of the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−) set in the rapid acceleration and deceleration range, has higher frequency that the values detected by the acceleration sensor316are included in this range while the vehicle is moving, thereby being able to increase the number of times of correction processes. The number of sets of the acceleration range and deceleration range contained in the plot range information may be three or more.

The first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) as well as the second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−) may also be set such that the ranges of the magnitude of the acceleration or deceleration are equal to each other and also the ranges of the vehicle speed are equal to each other. In this case, since an error component caused by acceleration and an error component caused by deceleration can cancel each other, a linear approximation can be calculated with further higher accuracy. The range width of the acceleration and deceleration ranges, the magnitude of the acceleration and deceleration and the like can be set based on an experiment or simulation by a designer.

FIG.7is a flow chart of the auto-leveling control of the vehicle lamp system according to the third exemplary embodiment. This flow is executed repeatedly at a given timing by the irradiation controller228R, more specifically, by thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2, when an ignition is switched on, for example, in a state where an instruction for execution of the auto-leveling control mode is given by the light switch304; and, when the ignition is turned off, this flow is ended.

Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whether the vehicle is moving (S201). If it is determined that the vehicle is moving(S201; Y), the control unit228R2determines whether the plots of the values detected by the acceleration sensor316in the set of first acceleration range P1(+) and first deceleration range P1(−) as well as the set of second acceleration range P2(+) and second deceleration range P2(−) are ready (S202). When the plots are not ready (S202; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2avoids the optical axis adjustment (S203) and ends this routine. When the plots are ready (S202; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates a linear approximation (S204), and calculates an error component Δθe which is a difference between a vehicle attitude angle θv derived from the slope of the linear approximation and the reference value of a vehicle attitude angle θv stored in the memory228R4(S205).

Thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whether the absolute value of the error component Δθe exceeds the threshold value θth (S206). If it is determined that the absolute value of the error component Δθe exceeds the threshold value θth (S206; Y), the control unit228R2corrects the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv and optical axis position by the correction value θc (S207). After then, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2avoids the optical axis adjustment with respect to a variation in the summed angle θ obtained from the value detected by the acceleration sensor316(S203) and ends this routine. If it is determined that the absolute value of the error component Δθe is equal to or less than the threshold value θth (S206; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2avoids the optical axis adjustment without executing the correction process (S203) and ends this routine.

If it is determined that the vehicle is not moving (S201; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2determines whetherit is whenthe vehicle is stopped (S208). If it is determined thatit is whenthe vehicle is stopped (S208; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates the road surface angle θr (S209) and stores the calculated road surface angle θr as a new reference value (S210), avoids the optical axis adjustment (S203) and ends this routine. If it is determined thatit is not whenthe vehicle is not stopped (S208; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates the vehicle attitude angle θv (S211) and determines whether a difference between the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv and the reference value of the vehicle attitude angle θv is equal to or more than a threshold (S212). If the difference is less than the threshold (S212; N), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2avoids the optical axis adjustment (S203) and ends this routine. If the difference equal to or more than the threshold (S212; Y), thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2adjusts the optical axis position according to the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv (S213), stores the calculated vehicle attitude angle θv as a reference value (S214) and ends this routine.

As described above, in the vehicle lamp system200according to this exemplary embodiment, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2calculates a linear approximation from the plots of the values detected by the acceleration sensor316when the acceleration of the vehicle300is within a given range and from the plots of the values detected by the acceleration sensor316when the deceleration of the vehicle300is within a given range. Therefore, an error component such as a vehicle attitude variation caused by the acceleration and an error component such as a vehicle attitude variation caused by the deceleration can cancel each other, thereby being able to calculate a linear approximation having a slope that is closer to the vehicle attitude angle θv.

Also, thecontrolcontroller/controlunit228R2carries out a correction process at the time when plots are obtained in the given acceleration range and deceleration range. In a control system configured such that a correction is carried out immediately after the vehicle stops by calculating a linear approximation from the values detected by the acceleration sensor316and recorded from the moving start to stop of the vehicle300, if. Ifthere is an error in the calculation of the vehicle attitude angle θv and optical axis adjustment while the vehicle is stopped after the correction, the vehicle300will move while containing such error. However, this exemplary embodiment can avoid such trouble.

Here, the vehicle lamp system200according to the above respective exemplary embodiments is a mode of the invention. This vehicle lamp system200includes the lamp unit10capable of adjusting its optical axis, acceleration sensor316, and irradiation controllers228L,228R for controlling the lamp unit10, while it carries out the above-mentioned auto-leveling control using the irradiation controllers228L,228R.

The other mode of the invention includes the irradiation controllers228L,228R respectively serving as control apparatus. The irradiation controllers228L,228R respectively include receivers228L1,228R1for receiving vehicle longitudinal direction and vertical direction acceleration from the acceleration sensor316,controlcontrollers/controlunits228L2,228R2for carrying out the above auto-leveling control, and transmitters228L3,228R3for transmitting control signals generated by thecontrolcontrollers/controlunits228L2,228R2to a leveling controller236. The irradiation controller228in the vehicle lamp system200corresponds to a controller in a broad sense, while thecontrolcontrollers/controlunits228L2,228R2in the irradiation controller228correspond to a controller in a narrow sense.

A further mode of the invention includes a method for controlling a vehicle lamp. This control method adjusts the optical axis of the lamp unit10based on a variation in the ratio between the temporal change amount of the vehicle longitudinal direction acceleration and the temporal change amount of the vehicle vertical direction acceleration during at least one of the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle300.

While the present invention has been described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments described above, and it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications, including combinations of features of different exemplary embodiments described above, may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.

For example, in the respective exemplary embodiments, the irradiation controller228may directly control the leveling actuator226serving as an optical axis adjusting portion, without a separate leveling controller236. That is, the irradiation controller228may function as the leveling controller236. The generation of a control signal for instruction of the optical axis adjustment in the above respective exemplary embodiments may also be carried out by the vehicle controller302. That is, the vehicle controller302may serve as a controller for carrying out the auto-leveling control. In this case, the irradiation controller228controls the drive of the leveling actuator226according to an instruction from the vehicle controller302.

In the first exemplary embodiment as well, similarly to the third exemplary embodiment, a correction process using a threshold value θth and a correction value θc may be carried out.

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to a braking force control system provided in a vehicle or the like.

Description of the Background Art

In a vehicle, for ease of driving, it is important to perform acceleration/deceleration as desired by a user without delay, and various techniques therefor have been proposed. Patent Literature 1 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. H10-280990) discloses a fuel cut control device in which a decelerating force is complemented by an alternator, an air-conditioner, a brake, a gear shift, etc., in the case of prohibiting fuel cut during deceleration in order to prevent degradation of a catalyst when the temperature of the catalyst is high. Patent Literature 2 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2006-297994) discloses a vehicle integrated control device in which a control target determined in accordance with an amount of operation by a driver is distributed to a drive system and a control system in accordance with an allocation ratio, and the control target before distribution is transmitted to a stabilization system and the stabilization system is caused to calculate a correction process, whereby synchronization of distributed values of the control target by the stabilization system is unnecessary, and delay is reduced with fail safety maintained.

During coasting driving in which a user does not depress any of an accelerator pedal and a brake pedal during driving, a braking force expected by the user can be estimated on the basis of a vehicle speed, a drive mode, a road surface gradient, etc. Meanwhile, a braking force can be determined by running resistance of the vehicle and control states of actuators that generate a braking force, such as a gear shift, fuel cut, and an alternator.FIG.6shows an example of a graph that compares a target braking force estimated as a braking force expected by the user during coasting driving to an actually generated braking force. In the example shown inFIG.6, settings are made such that, as a vehicle speed increases, the target braking force smoothly increases. However, during coasting driving, the actuators at least partially operate independently on the basis of requests from individual control systems for the actuators, and the actual braking force deviates from the target braking force. In particular, for example, the actual braking force greatly fluctuates through the target braking force with 40 km/h as a boundary between the case where fuel cut is performed and the case where fuel cut is not performed. As described above, the braking force of the entire vehicle is left to take its own natural course, and is not necessarily suitable for the user.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In view of the above-described problem, an object of the present invention is to provide a vehicular braking force control system, device, and method that can suitably obtain a braking force expected by a user in coasting driving.

In order to solve the above-described problem, an aspect of the present invention is a vehicular braking force control system including: a plurality of actuators capable of generating a braking force for a vehicle; a coasting state detection unit configured to detect that a coasting state, which is a state where an accelerator operation is not performed and a brake operation is not performed during running of the vehicle, has been established; a target braking force calculation unit configured to calculate a target braking force on the basis of a state of the vehicle when the coasting state detection unit detects that the coasting state has been established; and a braking force distribution control unit configured to determine a distribution braking force that is a braking force to be caused to be generated by each actuator, such that the distribution braking force is equal to or less than a braking force generable by the actuator and a sum of the distribution braking forces is equal to the target braking force, and perform control of causing each actuator to generate the distribution braking force.

According to the present invention, it is possible to provide a vehicular braking force control system, device, and method that can suitably obtain a braking force expected by a user in a coasting state of a vehicle.

Embodiment

A braking force control system according to an embodiment of the present invention calculates a suitable target braking force on the basis of a vehicle speed, etc., in a coasting state of a vehicle, collectively performs cooperative control of a plurality of actuators such as a brake and a transmission, and causes each actuator to generate a braking force within a range where a braking force is generable by the actuator, thereby achieving a target braking force.

Hereinafter, the embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.

<Configuration>

FIG.1shows a functional block diagram of a braking force control system10according to the present embodiment, and a peripheral portion thereof. The braking force control system10includes a braking force control device100and a plurality of actuators400(400-1 to 400-N). The actuators400are a brake, an alternator, an engine, a transmission, etc., which can generate a braking force in a vehicle that is running. The braking force control device100includes a coasting state detection unit11, a target braking force calculation unit12, and a braking force distribution control unit13. The braking force control system10is provided in the vehicle and connected to a brake pedal sensor201, an accelerator position sensor202, and a sensor/ECU group203including other various sensors and a control unit called an ECU. The braking force control device100acquires information representing various states of the vehicle and the vehicle periphery that are detected or controlled by the brake pedal sensor201, the accelerator position sensor202, and the sensor/ECU group203, and controls the actuators400on the basis of the acquired information.

<Process>

Hereinafter, a process executed by each component of the braking force control system10will be described.FIG.2is a sequence diagram illustrating the process. In addition,FIGS.3,4, and5are each a diagram showing an example of a map used for calculating a target braking force. The process is started when a user performs coasting driving in which the user does not perform an accelerator operation and does not perform a brake operation.

(Step S101): The coasting state detection unit11acquires information representing that a brake depression amount and an accelerator position are 0, from the brake pedal sensor201and the accelerator position sensor202, respectively, and detects that a coasting state has been established.

(Step S102): The target braking force calculation unit12acquires a running state, a control state, and the ambient environment of the vehicle, as a state of the vehicle, from the sensor/ECU group203. For example, as a state of the vehicle, the target braking force calculation unit12acquires a vehicle speed from a vehicle speed sensor or the like, acquires a drive mode representing a running characteristic designated by the user, from an ECU that manages various driving characteristics of the vehicle, or acquires the gradient of a road surface from an acceleration sensor or the like. Alternatively, the target braking force calculation unit12may acquire map information from a car navigation system, or acquire information about another vehicle or an obstacle around the vehicle, etc., from a camera or a radar.

(Step S103): The target braking force calculation unit12calculates a target braking force, as a suitable braking force estimated to be expected by the user, on the basis of the vehicle state. Examples of a method for calculating a target braking force will be described with reference toFIGS.3,4, and5. In each of the examples shown in these drawings, a map that determines a target braking force with respect to a vehicle speed in advance is used. In each example, settings are made such that a braking force is generated when a vehicle speed exceeds a predetermined value V0, and is increased as the vehicle speed increases. In the example shown inFIG.4, in consideration of a drive mode representing a running characteristic designated by the user, settings are made such that, when the drive mode is an eco mode that designates running with low fuel consumption, a braking force is lower than that in the case of a normal mode that is a drive mode other than the eco mode. For example, a map shown inFIG.3is used as a map for the case of the normal mode, and a map for the eco mode shown inFIG.4can be generated by using a value obtained by multiplying a value in the map shown inFIG.3by a coefficient β that is lower than 1. In the example shown inFIG.5, in further consideration of a road surface gradient, settings are made such that, when a road surface is downhill, a braking force is made larger than that in the case of a flat road. For example, the map shown inFIG.3is used as a map for the case of a flat road, and a map for a downhill road shown inFIG.5can be generated by using a value obtained by multiplying a value in the map shown inFIG.3by a coefficient β that is higher than 1. In addition, settings may be made such that, when a road surface is uphill, a braking force is made smaller than that in the case of a flat road. For example, the map shown inFIG.3is used as a map for the case of a flat road, and a map for an uphill road can be generated by using a value obtained by multiplying a value in the map shown inFIG.3by a coefficient γ that is lower than 1. In addition, a target braking force may be calculated on the basis of both the drive mode and the road surface gradient. For example, the map shown inFIG.3is used as a map for the case of a flat road and the normal mode, and a map for a downhill road and the eco mode can be generated by using a value obtained by multiplying a value in the map shown inFIG.3by the coefficient α and the coefficient β. Similarly, a map for an uphill road and the eco mode can be generated by using a value obtained by multiplying a value in the map shown inFIG.3by the coefficient α and the coefficient γ. In addition to or instead of these, another state may be used. For example, when presence of another vehicle within a predetermined distance in front of the vehicle is detected by a camera or a radar, a larger target braking force may be calculated than when such a vehicle is not present. According to these examples, a particularly suitable target braking force that fulfills a user's expectation can be calculated in accordance with various states of the vehicle. The above description is merely illustrative, and the method for calculating a target braking force is not particularly limited. As described above, a target braking force may be calculated by using different coefficients in accordance with the state of the vehicle, or a map that is individually generated in advance for each state may be used.

(Step S104): Each actuator400includes a calculation unit that calculates a generable braking force. In the case where the actuator400is, for example, a brake, the generable braking force can be calculated on the basis of one or a combination of a rating, an estimated friction material temperature based on latest use history within a predetermined period, a braking torque request value from another control system, etc. In addition, in the case where the actuator400is, for example, an alternator, the generable braking force can be calculated on the basis of one or a combination of a rating, a battery temperature, a battery charge amount (SOC), a charge/discharge request value from another control system, etc. Moreover, in the case where the actuator400is, for example, an engine, the generable braking force can be calculated on the basis of one or a combination of a catalyst warm-up state, a fuel cut request from another control system, etc. Furthermore, in the case where the actuator400is, for example, a transmission, the generable braking force can be calculated with constant accuracy on the basis of one or a combination of the level of noise generated in accordance with an engine speed and assumed at the time of downshifting, a gear shift request from another control system, etc. Each actuator400is not limited to these devices, and may be another device, or the generable braking force may be calculated on the basis of factors other than the above-described factors. The calculation unit of each actuator400notifies the braking force control device100of the calculated generable braking force. The calculation unit of each actuator400may perform such calculation and notification of the generable braking force at all times or in response to a request from the braking force control device100. As described above, the calculation unit of each actuator400calculates the generable braking force on the basis of the characteristics, the state, etc., of the actuator400, and thus the generable braking force of each actuator400can be accurately calculated.

(Step S105): The braking force distribution control unit13allocates a distribution braking force to each actuator400on the basis of the generable braking force calculated by the calculation unit of each actuator400and the target braking force calculated by the target braking force calculation unit12. The distribution braking force to be allocated to each actuator400is, for example, determined such that the distribution braking force is equal to or less than the braking force generable by the actuator400and the sum of the respective distribution braking forces is equal to the target braking force. That is, each distribution braking force is determined so as to satisfy a restrictive formula of Expression (1) below and also satisfy Expression (2).

In Expression (1), for the distribution braking force of each actuator400, an upper limit is provided as a restriction, and a lower limit is assumed to be 0. However, for each actuator400, a restriction that the lower limit of a braking force is larger than 0 can occur in accordance with a request from another control system. For example, in some cases, in an alternator, a request for generating power at high priority is received from a control system for a power supply when the amount of power stored in a battery is reduced, and power is generated in response to the request, whereby a braking force is generated. The braking force distribution control unit13may also acquire such a lower limit as a generable braking force calculated by the calculation unit of each actuator400, and determine each distribution braking force such that the above-described Expressions (1) and (2) are satisfied and Expression (3) below is further satisfied.

Priority may be provided for each actuator400on the basis of a predetermined control policy, and actuators400to which distribution braking forces is to be allocated and values of the distribution braking forces may be determined in order of the priority. That is, a distribution braking force that is as large as possible such that each expression described above is satisfied may be allocated in order starting from the actuator400with highest priority, and a distribution braking force that is as small as possible may be allocated to the actuator400with lowest priority. For example, the priority can be determined such that the priority is increased when durability is higher, fuel consumption is lower, or a period when a braking force can be continuously generated is longer.

Regarding the actuators400, among the transmission, the engine, the alternator, and the brake, the engine and the transmission, which constantly operate and generate or transmit a large force during running, generally have particularly high durability. As an example, when the transmission (gear shift down), the engine (fuel cut), the alternator (power generation), and the brake are higher in durability in this order, the transmission, the engine, the alternator, and the brake can be also set to be higher in priority in this order.

Some of the actuators400have a characteristic that it is temporarily hard to generate a braking force. In order to obtain certainty of generation of a braking force, the above-described priority may be increased for the actuator400having a higher possibility of being caused to generate a braking force at arbitrary timing. For example, among the transmission, the engine, the alternator, and the brake, the brake, which is designed to generate a braking force as a main purpose and has no factor that should inhibit generation of a braking force, generally has a highest possibility of being caused to generate a braking force at arbitrary timing. As an example, when the brake, the transmission, the engine, and the alternator are higher, in this order, in possibility of being caused to generate a braking force at arbitrary timing, the brake, the transmission, the engine, and the alternator can be also set to be higher in priority in this order.

In order to effectively obtain a braking force, the above-described priority may be increased for the actuator400having a larger generable braking force (braking torque amount). For example, among the transmission, the engine, the alternator, and the brake, the brake, which is designed to generate a braking force as a main purpose, is generally caused to generate a largest braking force. In addition, the transmission and the engine have higher mechanical resistance of internal components than the alternator, and can generate a larger braking force than the alternator. As an example, when the brake, the transmission, the engine, and the alternator are higher, in this order, in possibility of being caused to generate a large braking force, the brake, the transmission, the engine, and the alternator can be also set to be higher in priority in this order.

In order to accurately obtain a braking force, the above-described priority may be increased for the actuator400of which a braking force is easily controlled. For example, among the transmission, the engine, the alternator, and the brake, the brake, which is designed to generate a braking force as a main purpose, generally has a high possibility of being caused to accurately generate a desired braking force. In addition, the transmission and the alternator can control a braking force stepwise by changing a gear ratio and an amount of power generated, respectively, stepwise, as compared to fuel cut of the engine. As an example, when the brake, the transmission, the alternator, and the engine are higher, in this order, in possibility of being caused to accurately generate a braking force, the brake, the transmission, the alternator, and the engine can be also set to be higher in priority in this order.

In order to stably obtain a braking force, the above-described priority may be increased for the actuator400that is less susceptible to influence of disturbance and have more stable characteristics. For example, among the transmission, the engine, the brake, and the alternator, generally, a braking force of the transmission is determined in accordance with the gear ratio and is relatively less susceptible to influence of other factors. In addition, the operating characteristics of the alternator easily change depending on a difference in charge/discharge ability due to the temperature of the battery, etc. As an example, when the transmission, the engine, the brake, and the alternator are higher, in this order, in possibility of being less susceptible to influence of disturbance and having stable characteristics, the transmission, the engine, the brake, and the alternator can be also set to be higher in priority in this order.

In order to improve fuel economy or inhibit deterioration of fuel economy, the above-described priority may be increased for the actuator400that less adversely influences fuel economy. For example, among the transmission, the engine, the brake, and the alternator, generally, fuel cut in the engine and regenerative power generation by the alternator contribute to improvement of fuel economy. As an example, when the engine, the alternator, the transmission, and the brake are lower, in this order, in possibility of adversely influencing fuel economy, the engine, the alternator, the transmission, and the brake can be also set to be higher in priority in this order.

The above-described orders of priority are merely examples, and the methods for determining an order of priority and distribution braking forces are not limited to those described above. For example, the engine, the transmission, the alternator, and the brake can be set to be higher in priority in this order. According to this order of priority, for example, the engine and the transmission are preferentially used, so that deterioration of fuel economy can be inhibited by fuel cut of the engine and a braking force can be stably and effectively generated by the transmission. In addition, the order of priority may be set in accordance with the vehicle type, the drive mode, or the like. For example, in a fuel-efficient mode, priority may be set in order of the engine, the alternator, the transmission, and the brake, starting from one having a smaller adverse effect on fuel economy, and, in another mode, priority may be set in order of the transmission, the engine, the alternator, and the brake, starting from one having higher durability.

(Step S106): The braking force distribution control unit13instructs each actuator400to generate the allocated distribution braking force.

(Step S107): Each actuator400generates the distribution braking force in response to the instruction.

The above sequence is ended, for example, by the user performing an accelerator operation or a brake operation to cancel the coasting state. Until the sequence is ended, the processes from step S102to step S106are repeated, and braking force control corresponding to the speed of the vehicle or the like is continued. In addition, when coasting driving is performed again after the coasting state is cancelled, the process steps from step S101are executed again. Moreover, in the case where the vehicle is an electric vehicle, a motor only needs to be used instead of the engine, etc., as an actuator. Furthermore, the configuration of each component of the braking force control system according to the present invention is not limited to that in the present embodiment, and can be variously modified as long as the functions of: the plurality of actuators capable of generating a braking force for the vehicle; the target braking force calculation unit, which calculates a target braking force on the basis of the state of the vehicle; and the braking force distribution control unit, which determines a distribution braking force to be allocated to each actuator, such that the sum of the distribution braking forces is equal to the target braking force, and performs control of causing each actuator to generate the distribution braking force, when an accelerator operation is not performed and a brake operation is not performed during running of the vehicle, can be achieved. In addition, the plurality of actuators400may be actuators other than the brake, the alternator, the engine, and the transmission described as examples, as long as the actuators are functional units that are provided in the vehicle and capable of generating a braking force, and a combination of actuators is not limited as long as the number of the actuators is two or more.

In the case where the vehicle includes, as an external device for the braking force control system10, an in-vehicle device called a movement manager that integrally manages and controls movement of the vehicle, the braking force control system10may receive a target braking force, in the form of a braking force (N) or the like, from the movement manager.

In this case, the braking force control system10does not have to calculate a target braking force, and thus does not have to include the coasting state detection unit11and the target braking force calculation unit12. In addition, the braking force control system10does not have to acquire information from the brake pedal sensor201, the accelerator position sensor202, the sensor/ECU group203, etc. In this configuration, the braking force distribution control unit13notifies the movement manager of the range (availability) of the present generable braking force (N).

For example, the movement manager receives an acceleration/deceleration request, in the form of acceleration (m/s2) or the like, from at least still another in-vehicle device having a function to determine acceleration/deceleration or the like of the vehicle on the basis of information of various sensors or the like for driving assistance, and determines a target braking force within the range of the availability on the basis of the request and at least the availability.

The braking force distribution control unit13acquires a target braking force from the movement manager as described above. With such a configuration, the braking force control system10can receive a target braking force that matches with an acceleration/deceleration request from another in-vehicle device for performing various types of driving assistance, without independently calculating a target braking force. Accordingly, overlap of processes can be eliminated, and designing and mounting can be made easy, so that extension of a driving assistance function in the future can be easily handled. As described above, the braking force control system10may be mounted as a part of an integral driving assistance system that assumes use of a movement manager.

Advantageous Effects

According to the present invention, in a coasting state of the vehicle, a suitable target braking force expected by the user can be estimated on the basis of various states of the vehicle, and cooperative control of the plurality of actuators can be performed to generate a braking force such that the target braking force is achieved. Thus, suitable braking force control can be performed.

The present invention can be taken not only as a braking force control system including a braking force control device and actuators, but also as a method or a program to be executed by the braking force control device and a computer thereof, a computer-readable non-transitory storage medium having the program stored therein, or a vehicle including the braking force control system.

The present invention is useful for a braking force control system for a vehicle or the like.
